# 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Many (but not all) IDEs include a C++ compiler and a linker, which the IDE will know how to interface with in order to convert your source code into an executable file. And when you need to debug your program, you can use the integrated debugger.

To write a C++ program inside an IDE, we typically start by creating a new project. A **project** is a container that holds all of your source code files, images, data files, etc… that are needed to produce an executable (or library, website, etc…) that you can run or use. 

Each project corresponds to one program. When you’re ready to create a second program, you’ll either need to create a new project, or overwrite the code in an existing project (if you don’t want to keep it).

**Best practice:** Create a new project for each new program you write.

A **console project** means we create programs that can be run from the Windows, Linux, or Mac console.

## Workspaces / solutions

When you create a new project for your program, many IDEs will automatically add your project to a “workspace” or a “solution” (the term varies by IDE). A workspace or solution is a container that can hold one or more related projects. For example, if you were writing a game and wanted to have a separate executable for single player and multiplayer, you’d need to create two projects.

## Solution Explorer

In the Window titled *Solution Explorer*. Inside this window, Visual Studio has created a solution for you (*Solution ‘HelloWorld’*). Within that, with the name in bold, is your new project (*HelloWorld*).

## Running a program

Compile Program using *Ctrl+Shift+B*

Run compiled program using *Ctrl-F5*

When a code file is compiled, your IDE may cache the resulting object file. That way, if the program is compiled again in the future, any code file that hasn’t been modified doesn’t need to be recompiled -- the cached object file from last time can be reused.

With that in mind, here’s what each of the options typically does:

- **Build** compiles all *modified* code files in the project or workspace/solution, and then links the object files into an executable. If no code files have been modified since the last build, this option does nothing.
- **Clean** removes all cached objects and executables so the next time the project is built, all files will be recompiled and a new executable produced.
- **Rebuild** does a “clean”, followed by a “build”.
- **Compile** recompiles a single code file (regardless of whether it has been cached previously). This option does not invoke the linker or produce an executable.
- **Run/start** executes the executable from a prior build. Some IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio) will invoke a “build” before doing a “run” to ensure you are running the latest version of your code. 

Although we talk informally about “compiling” our programs, to actually compile our programs we will typically choose the “build” (or “run”) option in our IDE to do so.

## Build Configurations

A collectrion of project settings that determines how the IDE will build projects. 

The **debug configuration** is designed to help you debug your program, and is generally the one you will use when writing your programs. This configuration turns off all optimizations, and includes debugging information, which makes your programs larger and slower, but much easier to debug. The debug configuration is usually selected as the active configuration by default. We’ll talk more about debugging techniques in a later lesson.

The **release configuration** is designed to be used when releasing your program to the public. This version is typically optimized for size and performance, and doesn’t contain the extra debugging information. Because the release configuration includes all optimizations, this mode is also useful for testing the performance of your code.

**Best practice:** Use the *debug* build configuration when developing your programs. When you’re ready to release your executable to others, or want to test performance, use the *release* build configuration.

## Compiler Configurations

The C++ standard defines rules about how programs should behave in specific circumstances. And in most cases, compilers will follow these rules. However, many compilers implement their own changes to the language, often to enhance compatibility with other versions of the language (e.g. C99), or for historical reasons. These compiler-specific behaviors are called **compiler extensions**.

**Best practice:** Disable compiler extensions to ensure your programs (and coding practices) remain compliant with C++ standards and will work on any system.

### Warning and error Levels: 

When you write your programs, the compiler will check to ensure you’ve followed the rules of the C++ language. 

If you have done something that definitively violates the rules of the language, during compilation the compiler will emit an **error**, providing both line number containing the error, and some text about what was expected vs what was found. The actual error may be on that line, or on a preceding line. Once you’ve identified and fixed the erroneous line(s) of code, you can try compiling again.

In other cases, the compiler may find code that seems like it might be in error, but the compiler can’t be sure (remember the motto: “trust the programmer”). In such cases, the compiler may opt to issue a **warning**. Warnings do not halt compilation, but are notices to the programmer that something seems amiss.

**Best practice:**Don’t let warnings pile up. Resolve them as you encounter them (as if they were errors). Otherwise a warning about a serious issue may be lost amongst warnings about non-serious issues.

The warning level can be increase:

**Best practice:** Turn your warning levels up to the maximum, especially while you are learning. It will help you identify possible issues.

**Best practice:** Enable “Treat warnings as errors”. This will force you to resolve all issues causing warnings. (Just think that way)

## Language Standard

Here’s a mapping of code names to the final names:

- c++1x = C++11
- c++1y = C++14
- c++1z = C++17
- c++2a = C++20
- c++2b = C++23

For example, if you see `c++1z`, this is synonymous with the C++17 language standard.

In professional environments, it’s common to choose a language standard that is one or two versions back from the latest standard (e.g. now that C++20 is out, that means C++14 or C++17). This is typically done to ensure the compiler makers have had a chance to resolve defects, and so that best practices for new features are well understood. Where relevant, this also helps ensure better cross-platform compatibility, as compilers on some platforms may not provide full support for newer language standards immediately.

### Setting a language standard in Visual Studio

As of the time of writing, Visual Studio 2022 defaults to C++14 capabilities, which does not allow for the use of newer features introduced in C++17 and C++20.

To use these newer features, you’ll need to enable a newer language standard. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to do this globally -- you must do so on a project-by-project basis.

**Exporting your configuration**: In Visual Studio, this option is available via Project -> Export Template. Select “Project template”, add a name and optional description (e.g. C++20 console application), and then click “Finish”. Next time you create a new project, you’ll see this template show up in your list of project templates.
