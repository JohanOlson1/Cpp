## 7. Blocks

A **compound statement** (also called a **block**, or **block statement**) is a group of *zero or more statements* that is treated by the compiler as if it were a single statement.

Blocks begin with a `{` symbol, end with a `}` symbol, with the statements to be executed being placed in between.

Although functions can’t be nested inside other functions, blocks *can be* nested inside other blocks.

**Best practice:** Keep the nesting level of your functions to 3 or less. If your function has a need for more nested levels, consider refactoring your function into sub-functions.

Local variables have **block scope**, which means they are *in scope* from their point of definition to the end of the block they are defined within.

Identifiers have another property named `linkage`. An identifier’s **linkage** determines whether other declarations of that name refer to the same object or not.

Local variables have `no linkage`, which means that each declaration refers to a unique object. Eg. we use x in main and in a block inside main, no problem if first x is not used inside block!

The nested variable “hides” the outer variable in areas where they are both in scope. This is called **name hiding** or **shadowing**.

**Best practice:** Define variables in the most limited existing scope. Avoid creating new blocks whose only purpose is to limit the scope of variables.

Local variables with the same name as a global variable will shadow the global variable wherever the local variable is in scope.

**Best practice:** Avoid variable shadowing.

### Global Variables

In C++, variables can also be declared *outside* of a function. Such variables are called **global variables**.

By convention, global variables are declared at the top of a file, below the includes, but above any code. Here’s an example of a global variable being defined.

**Best practice:** Consider using a “g” or “g_” prefix for global variables to help differentiate them from local variables.

**Advice:** Prefix all non-namespaced global variables with “g” or “g_”, or better yet, put them in a namespace (constants namespace say)

Global variables have **file scope** (also informally called **global scope** or **global namespace scope**), which means they are visible from the point of declaration until the end of the *file* in which they are declared.

Because global variables are part of the global namespace, we can use the scope operator (::) with no prefix to tell the compiler we mean the global variable instead of the local variable.

#### Linkage

Global variable and functions identifiers can have either `internal linkage` or external linkage.

##### Internal linkage: 

An identifier with **internal linkage** can be seen and used within a single file, but it is not accessible from other files (that is, it is not exposed to the linker).

Global variables with internal linkage are sometimes called **internal variables**.

To make a non-constant global variable internal, we use the `static` keyword.

Const and constexpr global variables have internal linkage by default.

However, it’s worth noting that internal objects (and functions) that are defined in different files are considered to be independent entities (even if their names and types are identical), so there is no violation of the one-definition rule. Each internal object only has one definition.

Functions default to external linkage (which we’ll cover in the next lesson), but can be set to internal linkage via the `static` keyword.

##### External Linkage: 

An identifier with **external linkage** can be seen and used both from the file in which it is defined, and from other code files (via a forward declaration). In this sense, identifiers with external linkage are truly “global” in that they can be used anywhere in your program!

**Functions have external linkage by default**

But in order to call a function defined in another file, you must place a `forward declaration` for the function in any other files wishing to use the function.

To make a global variable external (and thus accessible by other files), we can use the `extern` keyword to do so.

To actually use an external global variable that has been defined in another file, you also must place a `forward declaration` for the global variable in any other files wishing to use the variable.

**Warning**: If you want to define an uninitialized non-const global variable, do not use the extern keyword, otherwise C++ will think you’re trying to make a forward declaration for the variable. (Declare and initialize at the same time)



The term “file scope” is more often applied to global variables with internal linkage, and “global scope” to global variables with external linkage (since they can be used across the whole program, with the appropriate forward declarations).

#### Why to avoid global avariables:

Although they may seem harmless in small academic programs, they are often problematic in larger ones.

Mostly about **non-const global** variables.

In short, global variables make the program’s state unpredictable. They could be changed easily! But constants prevent it.

**Best practice**: Use local variables instead of global variables whenever possible.

**If used:** There should only ever be one of the thing the variable represents in your program, and its use should be ubiquitous throughout your program.

##### Static Initialization:

In the static initialization phase, global variables with constexpr initializers (including literals) are initialized to those values. Also, global variables without initializers are zero-initialized. 

##### Dynamic Initialiation: 

This phase is more complex and nuanced, but the gist of it is that global variables with non-constexpr initializers are initialized. 

Forward declarations do not initialize, which can cause errors. 

But more of a problem, the order of initialization across different files is not defined.

**Warning**: Dynamic initialization of global variables causes a lot of problems in C++. Avoid dynamic initialization of global variables whenever possible.

#### Sharing global constants across files: 

1. Create a header file to hold these constants
2. Inside this header file, define a namespace (discussed in lesson [6.2 -- User-defined namespaces and the scope resolution operator](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/user-defined-namespaces-and-the-scope-resolution-operator/))
3. Add all your constants inside the namespace (make sure they’re *constexpr*)
4. \#include the header file wherever you need it

Example file: constants.h

```cpp
#ifndef CONSTANTS_H
#define CONSTANTS_H

// define your own namespace to hold constants
namespace constants
{
    // constants have internal linkage by default
    constexpr double pi { 3.14159 };
    constexpr double avogadro { 6.0221413e23 };
    constexpr double myGravity { 9.2 }; // m/s^2 -- gravity is light on this planet
    // ... other related constants
}
#endif
```

Then use the scope resolution operator (::) with the namespace name to the left, and your variable name to the right in order to access your constants in .cpp files. 

A downside is the need to include in potentially many files, which is expensive memory vise. 

##### External global variables:

The downsides can be solved by turning the global variables into external variables. 

Define constants in cpp file:

```cpp
#include "constants.h"

namespace constants
{
    // actual global variables
    extern const double pi { 3.14159 };
    extern const double avogadro { 6.0221413e23 };
    extern const double myGravity { 9.2 }; // m/s^2 -- gravity is light on this planet
}
```

Then put forward declarations in header file:

```cpp
#ifndef CONSTANTS_H
#define CONSTANTS_H

namespace constants
{
    // since the actual variables are inside a namespace, the forward declarations need to be inside a namespace as well
    extern const double pi;
    extern const double avogadro;
    extern const double myGravity;
}

#endif
```

The usage in the code files stay the same.

However, there are a couple of downsides to this method. First, these constants are now considered compile-time constants only within the file they are actually defined in. 

In other files, the compiler will only see the forward declaration, which doesn’t define a constant value (and must be resolved by the linker). This means in other files, these are treated as runtime constant values.

**Key insight:** In order for variables to be usable in compile-time contexts, such as array sizes, the compiler has to see the variable’s definition (not just a forward declaration).

Given the above downsides, prefer defining your constants in the header file, previous method!

#### Inline: 

Only from C++17 and forward.

 Let’s say you have a normal constant that you’re #including into 10 code files. Without inline, you get 10 definitions. With inline, the compiler picks 1 definition to be the canonical definition, so you only get 1 definition. This means you save 9 constants worth of memory.

Inline variables have two primary restrictions that must be obeyed:

1. All definitions of the inline variable must be identical (otherwise, undefined behavior will result).
2. The inline variable definition (not a forward declaration) must be present in any file that uses the variable.

Header file: 

```cpp
#ifndef CONSTANTS_H
#define CONSTANTS_H

// define your own namespace to hold constants
namespace constants
{
    inline constexpr double pi { 3.14159 }; // note: now inline constexpr
    inline constexpr double avogadro { 6.0221413e23 };
    inline constexpr double myGravity { 9.2 }; // m/s^2 -- gravity is light on this planet
    // ... other related constants
}
#endif
```

Cpp file: 

```cpp
#include "constants.h"

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a radius: ";
    int radius{};
    std::cin >> radius;

    std::cout << "The circumference is: " << 2.0 * radius * constants::pi << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

This method does retain the downside of requiring every file that includes the constants header to be recompiled if any constant value is changed. Otherwise superior to previous.

**Best practice**: If you need global constants and your compiler is C++17 capable, prefer defining inline constexpr global variables in a header file.
