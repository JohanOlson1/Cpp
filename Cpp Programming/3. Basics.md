# 3. Basics

A **statement** is a type of instruction that causes the program to *perform some action*.

- Each statement ends with a semicolon.

**Rule: **Every C++ program must have a special function named **main** (all lower case letters). When the program is run, the statements inside of *main* are executed in sequential order.

- Syntax is the grammar of programming, a syntax error is akin to misspelling.
- C++ is a whitespace-independent language, only inside quoted text do spaces matter.
- The return value from `main` is sometimes called a **status code** (also sometimes called an **exit code**)
  - The C++ standard only defines the meaning of 3 status codes: 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, and EXIT_FAILURE. 0 and EXIT_SUCCESS both mean the program executed successfully. EXIT_FAILURE means the program did not execute successfully.


## Preprocessor Derective

A special type of line. 

```
#include <iostream>
```

This preprocessor directive indicates that we would like to use the contents of the iostream library, which is the part of the C++ standard library that allows us to read and write text from/to the console.

## Comments

- Comments are made using: `//`

- Commenting multi line is done using: `/*` at start and `*/ ` at the end, they cannot be nested.

- A bad statement comment explains *what* the code is doing. If you ever write code that is so complex that needs a comment to explain *what* a statement is doing, you probably need to rewrite your statement, not comment it.

- Programmers often have to make a tough decision between solving a problem one way, or solving it another way. Comments are a great way to remind yourself (or tell somebody else) the reason you made one decision instead of another.

  **Best practice:** Comment your code liberally, and write your comments as if speaking to someone who has no idea what the code does. Don’t assume you’ll remember why you made specific choices.

## Objects and Variables

All computers have memory, called **RAM** (short for random access memory), that is available for your programs to use. 

- A single piece of data, stored in memory is called a **value**.

In some older programming languages you could directly access the memory. This is howerver discouraged. Instead we use an object to access memory. 

- A named object is called a **variable**. While its name is its **identifier**. 

A varible has to be declared using a **definition**, like:

```
int x; // define a variable named x, of type int
```

**Instantiation** is a fancy word that means the object will be created and assigned a memory address.

Several variables can be defined at the same time, of same type!

```
int a, b;
```

**Best practice:** Although the language allows you to do so, avoid defining multiple variables of the same type in a single statement. Instead, define each variable in a separate statement on its own line (and then use a single-line comment to document what it is used for).

Different ways to initialize

```
int a; // no initializer
int b = 5; // initializer after equals sign, copy initialization
int c( 6 ); // initializer in parenthesis, direct initialization
int d { 7 }; // initializer in braces, brace initialization
```

Brace initialization is the modern way to initialize objects in C++, unlike C!

- It allows initialization with a list of values 
- It disallows "narrowing conversions", trying to initialize with incorrect type. Will throw error. otherwise (int a = 4.5) becomes 4 for example

**Best practice:** Favor initialization using braces whenever possible.

When a variable is initialized with empty braces, **value initialization** takes place. In most cases, **value initialization** will initialize the variable to zero (or empty, if that’s more appropriate for a given type). In such cases where zeroing occurs, this is called **zero initialization**.

**Best practice:** Initialize your variables upon creation.

Unlike some programming languages, C/C++ does not initialize most variables to a given value (such as zero) automatically. Thus when a variable is given a memory address to use to store data, the default value of that variable is whatever (garbage) value happens to already be in that memory address!

**Rule:** Take care to avoid all situations that result in undefined behavior, such as using uninitialized variables.

## iostream - input/output library

Deals with basic input and output. 

Add before use, preferably at the top of code file

```
#include <iostream>

// rest of code that uses iostream functionality here
```

### Functions

**std::cout**

```
std::cout << "Hello world!" // << is the insertion operator

std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x; // Combination of text and object
```

Allows us to send data to the console to be printed. It can also print numbers, and values of objects. 

**std:endl** 

```
std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl; // std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line of the console
std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;
```

Moves to next line. 

**Best practice**: Output a newline whenever a line of output is complete.

It does another things however; makes sure the output shows up on the screen immediately. Therefore one often use '\n' instead in text. (and only end with it). 

**Best practice:** Prefer ‘\n’ over std::endl when outputting text to the console.

**std:cin** 

Reads input from from keyboard using the extractor operator `>>`. 

```
#include <iostream>  // for std::cout and std::cin

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number

    int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

Note that you don’t need to use ‘\n’ when accepting input, as the user will need to press the *enter* key to have their input accepted, and this will move the cursor to the next line. 

We can override the default precision that std::cout shows by using: 

```
std::cout << std::setprecision(16); // show 16 digits of precision
```

## Keywords

C++ reserves a set of 92 words (as of C++20) for its own use. These words are called **keywords** (or reserved words), and each of these keywords has a special meaning within the C++ language. Can be seen here: https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/keywords-and-naming-identifiers/

- The identifier can not be a keyword. Keywords are reserved.
- The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case), numbers, and the underscore character. That means the name can not contain symbols (except the underscore) nor whitespace (spaces or tabs).
- The identifier must begin with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore. It can not start with a number.
- C++ is case sensitive, and thus distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. `nvalue` is different than `nValue` is different than `NVALUE`.

Naming convention:

- Variable names should be only lowercase letter. 

- Instead of underscore one can use an uppercase letter (camelCase)

- Identifiers should make clear what they hold

- Make the length of the identifier proportional to its use, if the use is frequent; have a more descriptive and longer name.

  **Best practice:** When working in an existing program, use the conventions of that program (even if they don’t conform to modern best practices). Use modern best practices when you’re writing new programs.

## Formatting

- There are two acceptable styles for function braces. Recommended is

  ```
  int main()
  {
  }
  ```

- Each statement within curly braces should start one tab in from the opening brace of the function it belongs to. For example:

```
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // tabbed in one tab (4 spaces)
    std::cout << "Nice to meet you.\n"; // tabbed in one tab (4 spaces)
}
```

- Lines should not be too long. Typically, 80 characters is the maximum length a line should be. If a line is going to be longer, it should be split (at a reasonable spot) into multiple lines. This can be done by indenting each subsequent line with an extra tab, or if the lines are similar, by aligning it with the line above (whichever is easier to read).

- If a long line is split with an operator (eg. << or +), the operator should be placed at the beginning of the next line, not the end of the current line
- Use whitespace to make your code easier to read by aligning values or comments or adding spacing between blocks of code.

```
cost = 57;
pricePerItem = 24;
value = 5;
numberOfItems = 17;

vs 

cost          = 57;
pricePerItem  = 24;
value         = 5;
numberOfItems = 17;
```

**For Visual Studio users:** In Visual Studio, the automatic formatting options can be found under *Tools > Options> Text Editor

## Operators and literals

A **literal** is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code. The value is fixed and cannot be changed. 

In mathematics, an **operation** is a mathematical calculation involving zero or more input values (called **operands**) that produces a new value (called an output value).

Example of common nomenclature:bthe plus operator would be written *operator+*, and the extraction operator would be written *operator>>*.

Some operatorts are words (eg. delete). 

The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator’s *arity*: 

Operators in C++ come in four different *arities*:

- **Unary** operators act on one operand. An example of a unary operator is the *- operator*. For example, given `-5`, *operator-* takes literal operand *5* and flips its sign to produce new output value *-5*.

- **Binary** operators act on two operands (known as *left* and *right*). An example of a binary operator is the *+ operator*. For example, given `3 + 4`, *operator+* takes the left operand (3) and the right operand (4) and applies mathematical addition to produce new output value *7*. The insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators are binary operators, taking std::cout or std::cin on the left side, and the value to output or variable to input to on the right side.

- **Ternary** operators act on three operands. There is only one of these in C++ (the conditional operator), which we’ll cover later.

- **Nullary** operators act on zero operands. There is also only one of these in C++ (the throw operator), which we’ll also cover later.

An **expression** is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a single value. 

An **expression statement** is a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon. When the statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated. 

### Operators:

Precedence level 1 is the highest precedence level, and level 17 is the lowest. Operators with a higher precedence level get evaluated first.

![image-20221004132746217](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004132746217.png)

![image-20221004132800383](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004132800383.png)

In order to reduce mistakes and make your code easier to understand without referencing a precedence table, it’s a good idea to parenthesize any non-trivial compound expression, so it’s clear what your intent is.

**Best practice**: Outside of the operator precedence and associativity rules, assume that the parts of an expression could evaluate in any order. Ensure that the expressions you write are not dependent on the order of evaluation of those parts.

### Arithmetics:

![image-20221004133744235](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004133744235.png)

C++ does not include an exponent operator!

To do exponents in C++, #include the <cmath> header, and use the pow() function.

If you want to do integer exponentiation, you’re best off using your own function to do so. See example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint> // for std::int64_t
#include <cassert> // for assert

// note: exp must be non-negative
std::int64_t powint(std::int64_t base, int exp)
{
	assert(exp >= 0 && "powint: exp parameter has negative value");

	std::int64_t result{ 1 };
	while (exp)
	{
		if (exp & 1)
			result *= base;
		exp >>= 1;
		base *= base;
	}

	return result;
}

int main()
{
	std::cout << powint(7, 12); // 7 to the 12th power

	return 0;
}
```

**Warning:** In the vast majority of cases, integer exponentiation will overflow the integral type. This is likely why such a function wasn’t included in the standard library in the first place.

Increment/Decrement operators:

![image-20221004134215510](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004134215510.png)

**Best practice**: Strongly favor the prefix version of the increment and decrement operators, as they are generally more performant, and you’re less likely to run into strange issues with them.

**Warning**: C++ does not define the order of evaluation for function arguments or operator operands.

**Warning:** Don’t use a variable that has a side effect applied to it more than once in a given statement. If you do, the result may be undefined.

### Comma operator and conditional operators: 

![image-20221004134448759](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004134448759.png)

The **comma operator (,)** allows you to evaluate multiple expressions wherever a single expression is allowed. The comma operator evaluates the left operand, then the right operand, and then returns the result of the right operand. 

**Best practice:** Avoid using the comma operator, except within *for loops*.

### Ternary operator:

![image-20221004134647791](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004134647791.png)

**Best practice**: Always parenthesize the conditional part of the conditional operator, and consider parenthesizing the whole thing as well.

**Best practice:** Only use the conditional operator for simple conditionals where you use the result and where it enhances readability.

## Declarations and derectives

A **qualified name** is a name that includes an associated scope.

```cpp
class C; // some class

C::s_member; // s_member is qualified by class C
obj.x; // x is qualified by class object obj
ptr->y; // y is qualified by pointer to class object ptr
```

If a `using declaration` or `using directive` is used within a block, the names are applicable to just that block. 

**Best practice**: Prefer explicit namespaces over `using statements`. Avoid `using directives` whenever possible. `Using declarations` are okay to use inside blocks. Eg. don't bother with this!

### Declarations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   using std::cout; // this using declaration tells the compiler that cout should resolve to std::cout
   cout << "Hello world!\n"; // so no std:: prefix is needed here!

   return 0;
} // the using declaration expires here
```

If there’s a naming conflict between `std::cout` and some other use of `cout`, `std::cout` will be preferred.

### Derectives:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   using namespace std; // this using directive tells the compiler to import all names from namespace std into the current namespace without qualification
   cout << "Hello world!\n"; // so no std:: prefix is needed here
   return 0;
}
```

In modern C++, `using directives` generally offer little benefit (saving some typing) compared to the risk.

Greater risk of naming conflict.
