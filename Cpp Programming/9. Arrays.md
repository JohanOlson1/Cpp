# 		9. Arrays

An **array** is an aggregate data type that lets us access many variables of the same type through a single identifier.

```cpp
int testScore[30]{}; // allocate 30 integer variables in a fixed array
```

In an array variable declaration, we use square brackets ([]) to tell the compiler both that this is an array variable (instead of a normal variable), as well as how many variables to allocate (called the **array length**).

A **fixed array** (also called a **fixed length array** or **fixed size array**) is an array where the length is known at compile time. When testScore is instantiated, 30 integers will be allocated.

Arrays can be made from any data type.  The array is a variable of type[size].

Each of the variables in an array is called an **element**. Elements do not have their own unique names. Instead, to access individual elements of an array, we use the array name, along with the **subscript operator ([])**, and a parameter called a **subscript** (or **index**) that tells the compiler which element we want. This process is called **subscripting** or **indexing** the array.

Indexing starts at 0. 

Arrays can also be made from structs. Consider the following example:

```cpp
struct Rectangle
{
    int length{};
    int width{};
};
Rectangle rects[5]{}; // declare an array of 5 Rectangles
```

To access a struct member of an array element, first pick which array element you want, and then use the member selection operator to select the struct member you want:

```cpp
rects[0].length = 24;
```

When declaring a fixed array, the length of the array (between the square brackets) must be a compile-time constant. This is because the length of a fixed array must be known at compile time. Here are some different ways to declare fixed arrays:

```cpp
// using a literal constant
int numberOfLessonsPerDay[7]{}; // Ok

// using a constexpr symbolic constant
constexpr int daysPerWeek{ 7 };
int numberOfLessonsPerDay[daysPerWeek]{}; // Ok

// using an enumerator
enum DaysOfWeek
{
    monday,
    tuesday,
    wednesday,
    thursday,
    friday,
    saturday,
    sunday,

    maxDaysOfWeek
};
int numberOfLessonsPerDay[maxDaysOfWeek]{}; // Ok

// using a macro
#define DAYS_PER_WEEK 7
int numberOfLessonsPerDay[DAYS_PER_WEEK]{}; // Works, but don't do this (use a constexpr symbolic constant instead)
```

Because fixed arrays have memory allocated at compile time, that introduces two limitations:

- Fixed arrays cannot have a length based on either user input or some other value calculated at runtime.
- Fixed arrays have a fixed length that can not be changed.

In many cases, these limitations are problematic. Fortunately, C++ supports a second kind of array known as a **dynamic array**. The length of a dynamic array can be set at runtime, and their length can be changed.

**Best practice**: Explicitly initialize your arrays (even when the element type is self-initializing).

One of the big documentation problems with arrays is that integer indices do not provide any information to the programmer about the meaning of the index. Consider a class of 5 students. This can be solved by setting up an enumeration where one enumerator maps to each of the possible array indices:

```cpp
enum StudentNames
{
    kenny, // 0
    kyle, // 1
    stan, // 2
    butters, // 3
    cartman, // 4
    max_students // 5
};

int main()
{
    int testScores[max_students]{}; // allocate 5 integers
    testScores[stan] = 76;

    return 0;
}
```

Note that an extra enumerator named max_students has been added. This enumerator is used during the array declaration to ensure the array has the proper length (as the array length should be one greater than the largest index). This is useful both for documentation purposes, and because the array will automatically be resized if another enumerator is added.

**Rule**: When using arrays, ensure that your indices are valid for the range of your array!

## Length of an array

The std::size() function from the <iterator> header can be used to determine the length of arrays.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // for std::size

int main()
{
    int array[]{ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 };
    std::cout << "The array has: " << std::size(array) << " elements\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**Note** that due to the way C++ passes arrays to functions, this will *not* work for arrays that have been passed to functions!

**Note** that std::size returns an unsigned value. If you need a signed value, you can either cast the result or, since C++20, use std::ssize() (stands for signed size).

## Sorting

Sorting an array can make searching an array more efficient, not only for humans, but also for computers. 

The downside is, of course, that sorting an array is comparatively expensive, and it often isn’t worth sorting an array in order to make searching fast unless you’re going to be searching it many times.

Sorting is generally performed by repeatedly comparing pairs of array elements, and swapping them if they meet some predefined criteria. The order in which these elements are compared differs depending on which sorting algorithm is used.

Because sorting arrays is so common, the C++ standard library includes a sorting function named `std::sort`. `std::sort` lives in the <algorithm> header, and can be invoked on an array like so:

```cpp
#include <algorithm> // for std::sort
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // for std::size

int main()
{
	int array[]{ 30, 50, 20, 10, 40 };

	std::sort(std::begin(array), std::end(array));

	for (int i{ 0 }; i < static_cast<int>(std::size(array)); ++i)
		std::cout << array[i] << ' ';

	std::cout << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

Swapping pairs:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    int x{ 2 };
    int y{ 4 };
    std::cout << "Before swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << '\n';
    std::swap(x, y); // swap the values of x and y
    std::cout << "After swap:  x = " << x << ", y = " << y << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Multidimensional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays can be any dimension

2D:

```cpp
int array[3][5]; // a 3-element array of 5-element arrays
```

3D:

```cpp
int array[5][4][3];
```

C++ is a **row-major** ordered language. 

Initialize with nested braces:

```cpp
int array[3][5]
{
  { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, // row 0
  { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }, // row 1
  { 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 } // row 2
};
```

C++ will replace missing initializers with 0. 

## Pointers and arrays

In all but two cases (which we’ll cover below), when a fixed array is used in an expression, the fixed array will **decay** (be implicitly converted) into a pointer that points to the first element of the array. You can see this in the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int array[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

    // print address of the array's first element
    std::cout << "Element 0 has address: " << &array[0] << '\n';

    // print the value of the pointer the array decays to
    std::cout << "The array decays to a pointer holding address: " << array << '\n';


    return 0;
}
```

It’s a common fallacy in C++ to believe an array and a pointer to the array are identical. They’re not. In the above case, array is of type “int[5]”, and its “value” is the array elements themselves.

All elements of the array can still be accessed through the pointer.

This also effectively allows us to treat fixed arrays and pointers identically in most cases.

```cpp
int array[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

// Deferencing an array returns the first element (element 0)
std::cout << *array; // will print 9!

char name[]{ "Jason" }; // C-style string (also an array)
std::cout << *name << '\n'; // will print 'J'
```

Note that we’re not *actually* dereferencing the array itself. The array (of type int[5]) gets implicitly converted into a pointer (of type int*), and we dereference the pointer to get the value at the memory address the pointer is holding (the value of the first element of the array).

### Differences between pointers and arrays

There are a few cases where the difference in typing between fixed arrays and pointers makes a difference. 

The primary difference occurs when using the sizeof() operator. When used on a fixed array, sizeof returns the size of the entire array (array length * element size). When used on a pointer, sizeof returns the size of the pointer (in bytes). The following program illustrates this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int array[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

    std::cout << sizeof(array) << '\n'; // will print sizeof(int) * array length

    int* ptr{ array };
    std::cout << sizeof(ptr) << '\n'; // will print the size of a pointer

    return 0;
}
```

A fixed array knows how long the array it is pointing to is. A pointer to the array does not.

The second difference occurs when using the address-of operator (&). Taking the address of a pointer yields the memory address of the pointer variable. Taking the address of the array returns a pointer to the entire array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int array[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };
    std::cout << array << '\n';	 // type int[5], prints 009DF9D4
    std::cout << &array << '\n'; // type int(*)[5], prints 009DF9D4

    std::cout << '\n';

    int* ptr{ array };
    std::cout << ptr << '\n';	 // type int*, prints 009DF9D4
    std::cout << &ptr << '\n';	 // type int**, prints 009DF9C8

    return 0;
}
```

## Passing arrays to functions

Although passing an array to a function at first glance looks just like passing a normal variable, underneath the hood, C++ treats arrays differently.

Because copying large arrays can be very expensive, C++ does *not* copy an array when an array is passed into a function. Instead, the *actual* array is passed. This has the side effect of allowing functions to directly change the value of array elements!

If you want to ensure a function does not modify the array elements passed into it, you can make the array const.

When passing an array as an argument to a function, a fixed array decays into a pointer, and the pointer is passed to the function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printSize(int* array)
{
    // array is treated as a pointer here
    std::cout << sizeof(array) << '\n'; // prints the size of a pointer, not the size of the array!
}

int main()
{
    int array[]{ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 };
    std::cout << sizeof(array) << '\n'; // will print sizeof(int) * array length

    printSize(array); // the array argument decays into a pointer here

    return 0;
}
```

Note that this happens even if the parameter is declared as a fixed array,  C++ will implicitly convert parameter array[] to *array.

C++ implicitly converts parameters using the array syntax ([]) to the pointer syntax (*). That means the following two function declarations are identical:

```cpp
void printSize(int array[]);
void printSize(int* array);
```

**Best practice:** Favor the pointer syntax (*) over the array syntax ([]) for array function parameters.

Some programmers prefer using the [] syntax because it makes it clear that the function is expecting an array, not just a pointer to a value. However, in most cases, because the pointer doesn’t know how large the array is, **you’ll need to pass in the array size as a separate parameter anyway.**

**Note:** Finally, it is worth noting that arrays that are part of structs or classes do not decay when the whole struct or class is passed to a function. This yields a useful way to prevent decay if desired, and will be valuable later when we write classes that utilize arrays.

### Pointer Arithmetic (in Arrays)

The C++ language allows you to perform integer addition or subtraction operations on pointers. If `ptr` points to an integer, `ptr + 1` is the address of the next integer in memory after ptr. `ptr - 1` is the address of the previous integer before `ptr`.

Note that `ptr + 1` does not return the *memory address* after `ptr`, but the memory address of the *next object of the type* that `ptr` points to.

When calculating the result of a pointer arithmetic expression, the compiler always multiplies the integer operand by the size of the object being pointed to. This is called **scaling**.

**Arrays are laid out sequentially in memory**!

Therefore, we might conclude that adding 1 to an array should point to the second element (element 1) of the array. We can verify experimentally that this is true:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
     int array[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

     std::cout << &array[1] << '\n'; // print memory address of array element 1
     std::cout << array+1 << '\n'; // print memory address of array pointer + 1

     std::cout << array[1] << '\n'; // prints 7
     std::cout << *(array+1) << '\n'; // prints 7 (note the parenthesis required here)

    return 0;
}
```

Note that when performing indirection through the result of pointer arithmetic, parenthesis are necessary to ensure the operator precedence is correct, since operator * has higher precedence than operator +.

It turns out that when the compiler sees the subscript operator ([]), it actually translates that into a pointer addition and indirection! Generalizing, `array[n]` is the same as `*(array + n)`, where n is an integer. The subscript operator [] is there both to look nice and for ease of use (so you don’t have to remember the parenthesis).

We can use a pointer and pointer arithmetic to loop through an array. Although not commonly done this way (using subscripts is generally easier to read and less error prone). Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // for std::size

bool isVowel(char ch)
{
    switch (ch)
    {
    case 'A':
    case 'a':
    case 'E':
    case 'e':
    case 'I':
    case 'i':
    case 'O':
    case 'o':
    case 'U':
    case 'u':
        return true;
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

int main()
{
    char name[]{ "Mollie" };
    int arrayLength{ static_cast<int>(std::size(name)) };
    int numVowels{ 0 };

    for (char* ptr{ name }; ptr != (name + arrayLength); ++ptr)
    {
        if (isVowel(*ptr))
        {
            ++numVowels;
        }
    }

    std::cout << name << " has " << numVowels << " vowels.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

`std::begin` returns an iterator (pointer) to the first element

`std::end` returns an iterator to the element that would be one after the last. The iterator returned by `std::end` is only used as a marker, accessing it causes undefined behavior, because it doesn’t point to a real element.

Note:

```cpp
arr[2]
// same as
*(arr + 2)
// same as
*(2 + arr)
// same as
2[arr]
```

### Symbolic constants

C++ also supports a way to create C-style string symbolic constants using pointers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const char* myName{ "Alex" }; // pointer to symbolic constant
    std::cout << myName << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

In the symbolic constant case, how the compiler handles this is implementation defined. What *usually* happens is that the compiler places the string “Alex\0” into read-only memory somewhere, and then sets the pointer to point to it. Because this memory may be read-only, best practice is to make sure the string is const.

For optimization purposes, multiple string literals may be consolidated into a single value. For example:

```cpp
const char* name1{ "Alex" };
const char* name2{ "Alex" };
```

These are two different string literals with the same value. The compiler may opt to combine these into a single shared string literal, with both name1 and name2 pointed at the same address. Thus, if name1 was not const, making a change to name1 could also impact name2 (which might not be expected). 

C-style strings are used in a lot of old or low-level code, because they have a very small memory footprint. Modern code should favor the use `std::string` and `std::string_view`, as those provide safe and easy access to the string.

#### **std::cout and char pointers**

Observe how `std::cout` handles pointers of different types.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int nArray[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };
    char cArray[]{ "Hello!" };
    const char* name{ "Alex" };

    std::cout << nArray << '\n'; // nArray will decay to type int*
    std::cout << cArray << '\n'; // cArray will decay to type char*
    std::cout << name << '\n'; // name is already type char*

    return 0;
}
```

```
003AF738
Hello!
Alex
```

Why did the int array print an address, but the character arrays printed strings?

The answer is that `std::cout` makes some assumptions about your intent. If you pass it a non-char pointer, it will simply print the contents of that pointer (the address that the pointer is holding). However, if you pass it an object of type `char*` or `const char*`, it will assume you’re intending to print a string. Consequently, instead of printing the pointer’s value, it will print the string being pointed to instead!

While this is great 99% of the time, it can lead to unexpected results. Consider the following case:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char c{ 'Q' };
    std::cout << &c;

    return 0;
}
```

This case is somewhat unlikely to occur in real-life (as you’re not likely to actually want to print memory addresses), but it is illustrative of how things work under the hood, and how programs can inadvertently go off the rails.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

C++ supports three basic types of memory allocation, of which you’ve already seen two.

- **Static memory allocation** happens for static and global variables. Memory for these types of variables is allocated once when your program is run and persists throughout the life of your program.
- **Automatic memory allocation** happens for function parameters and local variables. Memory for these types of variables is allocated when the relevant block is entered, and freed when the block is exited, as many times as necessary.
- **Dynamic memory allocation** is the topic of this article.

Both static and automatic allocation have two things in common:

- The size of the variable / array must be known at compile time.
- Memory allocation and deallocation happens automatically (when the variable is instantiated / destroyed).

One issue is that if we have to declare the size of everything at compile time, the best we can do is try to make a guess the maximum size of variables we’ll need and hope that’s enough.

This is a poor solution for at least four reasons:

1. It leads to wasted memory if the variables aren’t actually used.
2. How do we tell which bits of memory are actually used? For strings, it’s easy: a string that starts with a \0 is clearly not being used. But what about monster[24]? Is it alive or dead right now? That necessitates having some way to tell active from inactive items, which adds complexity and can use up additional memory.
3. Most normal variables (including fixed arrays) are allocated in a portion of memory called the **stack**. The amount of stack memory for a program is generally quite small -- Visual Studio defaults the stack size to 1MB. If you exceed this number, stack overflow will result, and the operating system will probably close down the program.
4. It can lead to artificial limitations and/or array overflows. 

Fortunately, these problems are easily addressed via dynamic memory allocation. **Dynamic memory allocation** is a way for running programs to request memory from the operating system when needed. This memory does not come from the program’s limited stack memory -- instead, it is allocated from a much larger pool of memory managed by the operating system called the **heap**. On modern machines, the heap can be gigabytes in size.

### Allocating

To allocate a *single* variable dynamically, we use the scalar (non-array) form of the **new** operator:

```cpp
new int; // dynamically allocate an integer (and discard the result)
```

Most often, we’ll assign the return value to our own pointer variable so we can access the allocated memory later.

```cpp
int* ptr{ new int{2} }; // dynamically allocate an integer and assign the address to ptr so we can access it later, initialize it as well
```

If it wasn’t before, it should now be clear at least one case in which pointers are useful. Without a pointer to hold the address of the memory that was just allocated, we’d have no way to access the memory that was just allocated for us!

Unlike static or automatic memory, (we!) the program itself is responsible for requesting and disposing of dynamically allocated memory. 

### Deleting

When we are done with a dynamically allocated variable, we need to explicitly tell C++ to free the memory for reuse. For single variables, this is done via the scalar (non-array) form of the **delete** operator:

```cpp
// assume ptr has previously been allocated with operator new
delete ptr; // return the memory pointed to by ptr to the operating system
ptr = nullptr; // set ptr to be a null pointer
```

The delete operator does not *actually* delete anything. It simply returns the memory being pointed to back to the operating system. The operating system is then free to reassign that memory to another application.

A pointer that is pointing to deallocated memory is called a **dangling pointer**. Indirection through- or deleting a dangling pointer will lead to undefined behavior. Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int* ptr{ new int }; // dynamically allocate an integer
    *ptr = 7; // put a value in that memory location

    delete ptr; // return the memory to the operating system.  ptr is now a dangling pointer.

    std::cout << *ptr; // Indirection through a dangling pointer will cause undefined behavior
    delete ptr; // trying to deallocate the memory again will also lead to undefined behavior.

    return 0;
}
```

First, try to avoid having multiple pointers point at the same piece of dynamic memory. If this is not possible, be clear about which pointer “owns” the memory (and is responsible for deleting it) and which pointers are just accessing it.

Second, when you delete a pointer, if that pointer is not going out of scope immediately afterward, set the pointer to nullptr. We’ll talk more about null pointers, and why they are useful in a bit.

**Best practice:** Set deleted pointers to nullptr unless they are going out of scope immediately afterward.

#### Null Pointers

Null pointers (pointers set to nullptr) are particularly useful when dealing with dynamic memory allocation. In the context of dynamic memory allocation, a null pointer basically says “no memory has been allocated to this pointer”. This allows us to do things like conditionally allocate memory:

```cpp
// If ptr isn't already allocated, allocate it
if (!ptr)
    ptr = new int;
```

To delete it simply use:

```cpp
delete ptr;
```

If ptr is non-null, the dynamically allocated variable will be deleted. If it is null, nothing will happen.

### Memory Leaks

Dynamically allocated memory stays allocated until it is explicitly deallocated or until the program ends (and the operating system cleans it up, assuming your operating system does that). However, the pointers used to hold dynamically allocated memory addresses follow the normal scoping rules for local variables. This mismatch can create interesting problems.

Consider the following function:

```cpp
void doSomething()
{
    int* ptr{ new int{} };
}
```

This function allocates an integer dynamically, but never frees it using delete. Because pointers variables are just normal variables, when the function ends, ptr will go out of scope. And because ptr is the only variable holding the address of the dynamically allocated integer, when ptr is destroyed there are no more references to the dynamically allocated memory. This means the program has now “lost” the address of the dynamically allocated memory. As a result, this dynamically allocated integer can not be deleted.

This is called a **memory leak**.

Memory leaks happen when your program loses the address of some bit of dynamically allocated memory before giving it back to the operating system.

Memory leaks eat up free memory while the program is running, making less memory available not only to this program, but to other programs as well.

Only after your program terminates is the operating system able to clean up and “reclaim” all leaked memory.

Another memory leak can occur if a pointer holding the address of the dynamically allocated memory is assigned another value:

```cpp
int value = 5;
int* ptr{ new int{} }; // allocate memory
ptr = &value; // old address lost, memory leak results
```

Solved this way:

```cpp
int value{ 5 };
int* ptr{ new int{} }; // allocate memory
delete ptr; // return memory back to operating system
ptr = &value; // reassign pointer to address of value
```

Memory leaks can be avoided by ensuring you delete the pointer before reassigning.

### Arrays

To allocate an array dynamically, we use the array form of new and delete (often called new[] and delete[]):

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
    int length{};
    std::cin >> length;

    int* array{ new int[length]{} }; // use array new.  Note that length does not need to be constant!

    std::cout << "I just allocated an array of integers of length " << length << '\n';

    array[0] = 5; // set element 0 to value 5

    delete[] array; // use array delete to deallocate array

    // we don't need to set array to nullptr/0 here because it's going out of scope immediately after this anyway

    return 0;
}
```

Because we are allocating an array, C++ knows that it should use the array version of new instead of the scalar version of new. Essentially, the new[] operator is called, even though the [] isn’t placed next to the new keyword.

The length of dynamically allocated arrays has to be a type that’s convertible to `std::size_t`. In practice, using an `int` length is fine, since `int` will convert to `std::size_t`.

![image-20221013142231242](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221013142231242.png)

Note that because this memory is allocated from a different place than the memory used for fixed arrays, the size of the array can be quite large.

**When deleting a dynamically allocated array, we have to use the array version of delete, which is delete[].**

This tells the CPU that it needs to clean up multiple variables instead of a single variable. One of the most common mistakes that new programmers make when dealing with dynamic memory allocation is to use delete instead of delete[] when deleting a dynamically allocated array. Using the scalar version of delete on an array will result in undefined behavior, such as data corruption, memory leaks, crashes, or other problems.

**Dynamic arrays are almost identical to fixed arrays**

A fixed array can decay into a pointer that points to the first element of the array. In this decayed form, the length of the fixed array is not available (and therefore neither is the size of the array via sizeof()).

A dynamic array starts its life as a pointer that points to the first element of the array. Consequently, it has the same limitations in that it doesn’t know its length or size. A dynamic array functions identically to a decayed fixed array, with the exception that the programmer is responsible for deallocating the dynamic array via the delete[] keyword.

#### Allocating

If you want to initialize a dynamically allocated array to 0, the syntax is quite simple:

```cpp
int* array{ new int[length]{} };
```

Explicitly stating the size of the array is optional if elements are added.

Dynamically allocating an array allows you to set the array length at the time of allocation. However, C++ does not provide a built-in way to resize an array that has already been allocated.

Fortunately, if you need this capability, C++ provides a resizable array as part of the standard library called std::vector.

### Multidimensional Dynamically Allocated Array 

Unlike a two dimensional fixed array, which can easily be declare. Dynamically allocating a two-dimensional array is a little more challenging.

First, we allocate an array of pointers. Then we iterate through the array of pointers and allocate a dynamic array for each array element. Our dynamic two-dimensional array is a dynamic one-dimensional array of dynamic one-dimensional arrays!

```cpp
int** array { new int*[10] }; // allocate an array of 10 int pointers — these are our rows
for (int count { 0 }; count < 10; ++count)
    array[count] = new int[5]; // these are our columns
```

We can then access our array like usual.

With this method, because each array column is dynamically allocated independently, it’s possible to make dynamically allocated two dimensional arrays that are not rectangular

Deallocating a dynamically allocated two-dimensional array using this method requires a loop as well:

```cpp
for (int count { 0 }; count < 10; ++count)
    delete[] array[count];
delete[] array; // this needs to be done last
```

Note that we delete the array in the opposite order that we created it (elements first, then the array itself). If we delete array before the array columns, then we’d have to access deallocated memory to delete the array columns. And that would result in undefined behavior.

Because allocating and deallocating two-dimensional arrays is complex and easy to mess up, it’s often easier to “flatten” a two-dimensional array (of size x by y) into a one-dimensional array of size x * y:

```cpp
int *array { new int[50] }; // a 10x5 array flattened into a single array
```

Simple math can then be used to convert a row and column index for a rectangular two-dimensional array into a single index for a one-dimensional array. 

**Note:** Triple pointer used to dynamically allocate a three-dimensional array. However, doing so would require a loop inside a loop, and is extremely complicated to get correct. 

## std::array and std::vector

### std::array

Fixed arrays decay into pointers, losing the array length information when they do, and dynamic arrays have messy deallocation issues and are challenging to resize without error.

To address these issues, the C++ standard library includes functionality that makes array management easier, `std::array` and `std::vector`.

`std::array` provides fixed array functionality that won’t decay when passed into a function. `std::array` is defined in the `<array>` header, inside the `std` namespace.

Example:

```cpp
#include <array>

std::array<int, 3> myArray; // declare an integer array with length 3
```

```cpp
std::array myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // The type is deduced to std::array<int, 5>
std::array myArray { 9.7, 7.31 }; // The type is deduced to std::array<double, 2>
```

**Note:** The `size()` function can be used to retrieve the length of the `std::array`. 

**Note:** Because `std::array` doesn’t decay to a pointer when passed to a function, the `size()` function will work even if you call it from within a function. 

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

void printLength(const std::array<double, 5>& myArray)
{
    std::cout << "length: " << myArray.size() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8 };

    printLength(myArray);

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice:** Always pass `std::array` by reference or `const` reference

**Note:** Because the length is always known, range-based for-loops work with `std::array`.

With a std::array, the element type and array length are part of the type information. Therefore, when we use a std::array as a function parameter, we have to specify the element type and array length.

The downside is that this limits our function to only handling arrays of this specific type and length.

Fortunately, we can have C++ do this for us, using templates. We can create a template function that parameterizes part or all of the type information, and then C++ will use that template to create “real” functions (with actual types) as needed.

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>

// printArray is a template function
template <typename T, std::size_t size> // parameterize the element type and size
void printArray(const std::array<T, size>& myArray)
{
    for (auto element : myArray)
        std::cout << element << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::array myArray5{ 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8 };
    printArray(myArray5);

    std::array myArray7{ 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8, 1.2, 0.7 };
    printArray(myArray7);

    return 0;
```

**Warning:** Due to a curious decision, the `size()` function and array index parameter to `operator[]` use a type called `size_type`, which is defined by the C++ standard as an *unsigned* integral type.  This can cause issues when indexing!

A solution is to avoid manual indexing of `std::array` in the first place. Instead, use range-based for-loops (or iterators) if possible.

**Conclusion:** `std::array` is a great replacement for built-in fixed arrays. It’s efficient, in that it doesn’t use any more memory than built-in fixed arrays. The only real downside of a `std::array` over a built-in fixed array is a slightly more awkward syntax, that you have to explicitly specify the array length (the compiler won’t calculate it for you from the initializer, unless you also omit the type, which isn’t always possible), and the signed/unsigned issues with size and indexing. But those are comparatively minor quibbles — we recommend using `std::array` over built-in fixed arrays for any non-trivial array use.

### std::vector

The C++ standard library provides functionality that makes working with dynamic arrays safer and easier. This functionality is named `std::vector`.

`std::vector` provides dynamic array functionality that handles its own memory management. This means you can create arrays that have their length set at run-time, without having to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory using `new` and `delete`. `std::vector` lives in the `<vector>` header.

Example:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// no need to specify length at the declaration
std::vector<int> array;
std::vector<int> array2 = { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // use initializer list to initialize array (before C++11)
std::vector<int> array3 { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // use uniform initialization to initialize array

// as with std::array, the type can be omitted since C++17
std::vector array4 { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // deduced to std::vector<int>
```

Note that in both the uninitialized and initialized case, you do not need to include the array length at compile time. This is because `std::vector` will dynamically allocate memory for its contents as requested.

#### Self Cleanup Prevents Memory Leaks

When a vector variable goes out of scope, it automatically deallocates the memory it controls (if necessary). This is not only handy (as you don’t have to do it yourself), it also helps prevent memory leaks. 

#### Vectors remember their length

Unlike built-in dynamic arrays, which don’t know the length of the array they are pointing to, std::vector keeps track of its length. We can ask for the vector’s length via the `size()` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void printLength(const std::vector<int>& array)
{
    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::vector array { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };
    printLength(array);

    std::vector<int> empty {};
    printLength(empty);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Resizing

Resizing a built-in dynamically allocated array is complicated. Resizing a `std::vector` is as simple as calling the `resize()` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector array { 0, 1, 2 };
    array.resize(5); // set size to 5

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';

    for (int i : array)
        std::cout << i << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

There are two things to note here. First, when we resized the vector, the existing element values were preserved! Second, new elements are initialized to the default value for the type (which is 0 for integers).

Resizing a vector is computationally expensive, so you should strive to minimize the number of times you do so. 

**Conclusion:** Because variables of type `std::vector` handle their own memory management (which helps prevent memory leaks), remember their length, and can be easily resized, we recommend using `std::vector` in most cases where dynamic arrays are needed.

#### Length vs Capacity

Consider the following example:

```cpp
int* array{ new int[10] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } };
```

We would say that this array has a length of 10, even though we’re only using 5 of the elements that we allocated.

Unlike a built-in array or a std::array, which only remembers its length, std::vector contains two separate attributes: length and capacity. In the context of a std::vector, **length** is how many elements are being used in the array, whereas **capacity** is how many elements were allocated in memory.

We can ask the std::vector what its capacity is via the capacity() function:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::vector array { 0, 1, 2 };
    array.resize(5); // set length to 5

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';
    std::cout << "The capacity is: " << array.capacity() << '\n';
}
```

It behaves nicely, the range for the subscript operator ([]) and at() function is based on the vector’s length, not the capacity. 

Note that a vector will not resize itself based on a call to the subscript operator or at() function!

#### Stack behavior

Although std::vector can be used as a dynamic array, it can also be used as a stack. To do this, we can use 3 functions that match our key stack operations:

- push_back() pushes an element on the stack.
- back() returns the value of the top element on the stack.
- pop_back() pops an element off the stack.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void printStack(const std::vector<int>& stack)
{
	for (auto element : stack)
		std::cout << element << ' ';
	std::cout << "(cap " << stack.capacity() << " length " << stack.size() << ")\n";
}

int main()
{
	std::vector<int> stack{};
    
    // stack.reserve(5); // Set the capacity to (at least) 5

	printStack(stack);

	stack.push_back(5); // push_back() pushes an element on the stack
	printStack(stack);

	stack.push_back(3);
	printStack(stack);

	stack.push_back(2);
	printStack(stack);

	std::cout << "top: " << stack.back() << '\n'; // back() returns the last element

	stack.pop_back(); // pop_back() pops an element off the stack
	printStack(stack);

	stack.pop_back();
	printStack(stack);

	stack.pop_back();
	printStack(stack);

	return 0;
}
```

Unlike array subscripts or at(), the stack-based functions *will* resize the std::vector if necessary. In the example above, the vector gets resized 3 times (from a capacity of 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3).

Because resizing the vector is expensive, we can tell the vector to allocate a certain amount of capacity up front using the reserve() function.

#### Vectors may allocate extra capacity

When a vector is resized, the vector may allocate more capacity than is needed. This is done to provide some “breathing room” for additional elements, to minimize the number of resize operations needed. 

If, when, and how much additional capacity is allocated is left up to the compiler implementer.
