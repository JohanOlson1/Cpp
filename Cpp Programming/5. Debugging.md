# 5. Debugging

Errors generally fall into one of two categories: syntax errors, and semantic errors (logic errors).

A **syntax error** occurs when you write a statement that is not valid according to the grammar of the C++ language. This includes errors such as missing semicolons, using undeclared variables, mismatched parentheses or braces, etc… For example, the following program contains quite a few syntax errors:

A **semantic error** occurs when a statement is syntactically valid, but does not do what the programmer intended.

### A general approach to debugging

Once a problem has been identified, debugging the problem generally consists of five steps:

1. Find the root cause of the problem (usually the line of code that’s not working)
2. Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring
3. Determine how you’ll fix the issue
4. Repair the issue causing the problem
5. Retest to ensure the problem has been fixed and no new problems have emerged

When debugging a program, in most cases the vast majority of your time will be spent trying to find where the error actually is. Once the issue is found, the remaining steps (fixing the issue and validating that the issue was fixed) are often trivial in comparison.

It’s almost impossible to visually spot a bug caused by a bad assumption, because you’re likely to make the same bad assumption when inspecting the code, and not notice the error.

The first and most important step in finding a problem is to be able to *reproduce the problem*. Reproducing the problem means making the problem appear in a consistent manner.

#### Basic Debuggning tactics:

1. Commenting out code
2. Validating your code flow
   - Print to find function calls, when printing information for debugging purposes, use std::cerr instead of std::cout. (not buffered)
3. Printing values

Printing is not great though

1. Debug statements clutter your code.
2. Debug statements clutter the output of your program.
3. Debug statements must be removed after you’re done with them, which makes them non-reusable.
4. Debug statements require modification of your code to both add and to remove, which can introduce new bugs.

#### **Conditionalizing your debugging code:**

One way to make it easier to disable and enable debugging throughout your program is to make your debugging statements conditional using preprocessor directives.

If this were a multi-file program, the #define ENABLE_DEBUG would go in a header file that’s included into all code files so we can comment / uncomment the #define in a single location and have it propagate to all code files.

This addresses the issue with having to remove debug statements and the risk in doing so, but at the cost of even more code clutter.

#### Using a logger:

A **log file** is a file (normally stored on disk) that records events that occur in software. 

### Integrated Debugger

When you run your program, execution begins at the top of the *main* function, and then proceeds sequentially statement by statement, until the program ends. At any point in time while your program is running, the program is keeping track of a lot of things: the value of the variables you’re using, which functions have been called (so that when those functions return, the program will know where to go back to), and the current point of execution within the program (so it knows which statement to execute next). All of this tracked information is called your **program state** (or just *state*, for short).

The power behind the debugger is twofold: the ability to precisely control execution of the program, and the ability to view (and modify, if desired) the program’s state.

Early debuggers, such as [gdb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdb), were separate programs that had command-line interfaces, where the programmer had to type arcane commands to make them work. 

While integrated debuggers are highly convenient and recommended for beginners, command line debuggers are well supported and commonly used in environments that do not support graphical interfaces (e.g. embedded systems).

**Tip:** Don’t neglect learning to use a debugger. As your programs get more complicated, the amount of time you spend learning to use the integrated debugger effectively will pale in comparison to amount of time you save finding and fixing issues.

#### Stepping:

**Stepping** is the name for a set of related debugger features that let us execute (step through) our code statement by statement. 

##### **Step into:** 

Execute the next statement. (the *step into* command can be accessed via *Debug menu > Step Into*, or by pressing the F11 shortcut key.)

- The program will recompile if needed.
- The program will begin to run. Because our application is a console program, a console output window should open. It will be empty because we haven’t output anything yet.
- Your IDE may open some diagnostic windows, which may have names such as “Diagnostic Tools”, “Call Stack”, and “Watch”.

This arrow marker indicates that the line being pointed to will be executed next.

##### Step over: 

Like *step into*, The **step over** command executes the next statement in the normal execution path of the program. However, whereas *step into* will enter function calls and execute them line by line, *step over* will execute an entire function without stopping and return control to you after the function has been executed.

(In Visual Studio, the *step over* command can be accessed via *Debug menu > Step Over*, or by pressing the F10 shortcut key.)

##### Step out: 

Unlike the other two stepping commands, **Step out** does not just execute the next line of code. Instead, it executes all remaining code in the function currently being executed, and then returns control to you when the function has returned.

(In Visual Studio, the *step out* command can be accessed via *Debug menu > Step Out*, or by pressing the Shift-F11 shortcut combo.)

##### Step back:

When stepping through a program, you can normally only step forward. It’s very easy to accidentally step past (overstep) the place you wanted to examine.

If you step past your intended destination, the usual thing to do is stop debugging and restart debugging again, being a little more careful not to pass your target this time.

Some debuggers (such as Visual Studio Enterprise Edition and GDB 7.0) have introduced a stepping capability generally referred to as *step back* or *reverse debugging*.

#### Running and Breakpoints:

##### Run to cursor:

Executes the program until it reaches the selected statement.

(In Visual Studio, the *run to cursor* command can be accessed by right clicking a statement in your code and choosing *Run to Cursor* from the context menu) 

If you *run to cursor* to a location that doesn’t execute, *run to cursor* will simply run your program until termination.

##### Continue:

The **continue** debug command simply continues running the program as per normal, either until the program terminates, or until something triggers control to return back to you again (such as a breakpoint). 

(In Visual Studio, the *continue* command can be accessed while already debugging a program via *Debug menu > Continue*)

##### Start:

The *continue* command has a twin brother named *start*. The *start* command performs the same action as *continue*, just starting from the beginning of the program. It can only be invoked when not already in a debug session.

##### Breakpoints:

A **breakpoint** is a special marker that tells the debugger to stop execution of the program at the breakpoint when running in debug mode. 

(In Visual Studio, you can set or remove a breakpoint via *Debug menu > Toggle Breakpoint*, or by right clicking on a statement and choosing *Toggle Breakpoint* from the context menu, or by pressing the F9 shortcut key, or by clicking to the left of the line number (in the light grey area).)

Breakpoints have a couple of advantages over *run to cursor*. First, a breakpoint will cause the debugger to return control to you every time they are encountered (unlike *run to cursor*, which only runs when it is invoked). Second, you can set a breakpoint and it will persist until you remove it, whereas with *run to cursor* you have to locate the spot you want to run to each time you invoke the command.

##### Set next statement: 

The **set next statement** command allows us to change the point of execution to some other statement (sometimes informally called *jumping*). This can be used to jump the point of execution forwards and skip some code that would otherwise execute, or backwards and have something that already executed run again.

(In Visual Studio, you can jump the point of execution by right clicking on a statement and choosing *Set next statement* from the context menu, or by pressing the Ctrl-Shift-F10 shortcut combination. This option is contextual and only occurs while already debugging a program.)

#### Watching variables

Run to a specific line, then you can see the value of initialized variables.

The easiest way to examine the value of a simple variable like x is to hover your mouse over the variable x. Some modern debuggers support this method of inspecting simple variables, and it is the most straightforward way to do so.

Note that you can hover over any variable x, not just the one on the current line. Each displaying the value of x at the current line.

If you’re using Visual Studio, you can also use QuickWatch. Highlight the variable name x with your mouse, and then choose “QuickWatch” from the right-click menu.

##### **The watch window:**

The **watch window** is a window where you can add variables you would like to continually inspect, and these variables will be updated as you step through your program.

(In Visual Studio, the watch menu can be found at *Debug menu > Windows > Watch > Watch 1*. Do note that you have to be in debug mode for this option to be enabled, so *step into* your program first.)

Variables that go out of scope (e.g. a local variable inside a function that has already returned to the caller) will stay in your watch window, but will generally either be marked as “not available”, or may show the last known value but grayed out. 

##### Local watches: 

Because inspecting the value of local variables inside a function is common while debugging, many debuggers will offer some way to quickly watch the value of *all* local variables in scope.

(In Visual Studio, you can see the value of all local variables in the *Locals* window, which can be found at *Debug menu > Windows > Locals*. Note that you have to be in a debug session to activate this window)

#### The call stack

The **call stack** is a list of all the active functions that have been called to get to the current point of execution. The call stack includes an entry for each function called, as well as which line of code will be returned to when the function returns. 

Whenever a new function is called, that function is added to the top of the call stack. When the current function returns to the caller, it is removed from the top of the call stack, and control returns to the function just below it.

(In Visual Studio, the call stack window can be found via *Debug menu > Windows > Call Stack*. Note that you have to be in a debug session to activate this window.)

The *line 5* next to function *a* shows us where the current point of execution is (which matches the execution marker in the code window). The *line 17* on the second line indicates the line that will be returned to when control returns to function *main*.

### Don’t make errors

Well, the best thing is to not make errors in the first place. Here’s an incomplete list of things that can help avoid making errors:

- Follow best practices
- Don’t program when tired
- Understand where the common pitfalls are in a language (all those things we warn you not to do)
- Keep your programs simple
- Don’t let your functions get too long
- Prefer using the standard library to writing your own code, when possible
- Comment your code liberally

**Key insight:** When making changes to your code, make behavioral changes OR structural changes, and then retest for correctness. Making behavioral and structural changes at the same time tends to lead to more errors as well as errors that are harder to find.

**Defensive programming** is a practice whereby the programmer tries to anticipate all of the ways the software could be misused, either by end-users, or by other developers (including the programmer themselves) using the code. These misuses can often be detected and then mitigated (e.g. by asking a user who entered bad input to try again).

##### Static Analysis Tools: 

Programmers tend to make certain kinds of common mistakes, and some of those mistakes can be discovered by programs trained to look for them. These programs, generally known as **static analysis tools** (sometimes informally called *linters*) are programs that analyze your code to identify specific semantic issues.

On larger non-academic programs, use of a static analysis tool is highly recommended.

**Best practice:** Use a static analysis tool on your programs to help find areas where your code is non-compliant with best practices.

(Visual Studio 2019 comes with a built-in static analysis tool. You can access it via *Build > Run Code Analysis on Solution (Alt+F11)*)
