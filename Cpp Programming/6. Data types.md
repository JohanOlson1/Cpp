# 6. Data types

One byte is 8 bits!

**Key insight:** In C++, we typically work with “byte-sized” chunks of data.

The data type declares a piece of memory to be interpreted as a specific type. 

## Object sizes:

Most objects actually take up more than 1 byte of memory. A single object may use 2, 4, 8, or even more consecutive memory addresses. The amount of memory that an object uses is based on its data type. 

To generalize, an object with *n* bits (where n is an integer) can hold $2^n$ unique values.

**Key insight**: New programmers often focus too much on optimizing their code to use as little memory as possible. In most cases, this makes a negligible difference. Focus on writing maintainable code, and optimize only when and where the benefit will be substantive.

 You may be surprised to find that the size of a given data type is dependent on the compiler and/or the computer architecture! These are the minimum size in C++:

### Sizeof operator:

```cpp
sizeof();
```

Unary operator. 

Input is either type or variable.

Output is is its size in bytes.

Note that you can not use the *sizeof* operator on the *void* type, since it has no size.

#### Scienfitic Notation:

Written as:

1.2e4 or 1.2e-5

## Fundamental Data types:

C++ comes with built-in support for many different data types. These are called **fundamental data types**.

![image-20221004095912020](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004095912020.png)



### Void:

*Void* basically means "no type". 

Used to indicate a function not returning a value. 

**Best practice:** Use an empty parameter list instead of *void* to indicate that a function has no parameters. 

### Signed integers:

An **integer** is an integral type that can represent positive and negative whole numbers. 4 types in C++:

![image-20221004101248251](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004101248251.png)

Defined the following way:

```cpp
short s;      // prefer "short" instead of "short int" 			127
int i;														32 767	
long l;       // prefer "long" instead of "long int"			2 147 483 647 
long long ll; // prefer "long long" instead of "long long int"	 loooong
```

**Best practice:** Prefer the shorthand types that do not use the *int* suffix or signed prefix.

The range of the types are $2^{n-1}-1$. 

**Warning:** Signed integer overflow will result in undefined behavior.

#### Integer division:

When doing division with two integers (called **integer division**), C++ always produces an integer result. Since integers can’t hold fractional values, any fractional portion is simply dropped (not rounded!).

#### Unsigned integers:

**Unsigned integers** are integers that can only hold non-negative whole numbers.

```cpp
unsigned short us;
unsigned int ui;
unsigned long ul;
unsigned long long ull;
```

When no negative numbers are required, unsigned integers are well-suited for networking and systems with little memory, because unsigned integers can store more positive numbers without taking up extra memory.

Many developers (and some large development houses, such as Google) believe that developers should generally avoid unsigned integers.

Unexpected behavior can result when you mix signed and unsigned integers.

**Best practice**: Favor signed numbers over unsigned numbers for holding quantities (even quantities that should be non-negative) and mathematical operations. Avoid mixing signed and unsigned numbers.

##### Why isn’t the size of the integer variables fixed?

The short answer is that this goes back to C, when computers were slow and performance was of the utmost concern. C opted to intentionally leave the size of an integer open so that the compiler implementers could pick a size for int that performs best on the target computer architecture.

**Fixed-width integers**: To address the above issues, C99 defined a set of **fixed-width integers** (in the stdint.h header) that are guaranteed to be the same size on any architecture.

![image-20221004102627960](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004102627960.png)

Need to include: <cstdint>

Just because your CPU can process a given type faster doesn’t mean your program will be faster overall -- modern programs are often constrained by memory usage rather than CPU, and the larger memory footprint may slow your program more than the faster CPU processing accelerates it. It’s hard to know without actually measuring. 

**Best practice:**

- Prefer `int` when the size of the integer doesn’t matter (e.g. the number will always fit within the range of a 2-byte signed integer). For example, if you’re asking the user to enter their age, or counting from 1 to 10, it doesn’t matter whether int is 16 or 32 bits (the numbers will fit either way). This will cover the vast majority of the cases you’re likely to run across.
- Prefer `std::int#_t` when storing a quantity that needs a guaranteed range.
- Prefer `std::uint#_t` when doing bit manipulation or where well-defined wrap-around behavior is required.

Avoid the following when possible:

- Unsigned types for holding quantities
- The 8-bit fixed-width integer types
- The fast and least fixed-width types
- Any compiler-specific fixed-width integers -- for example, Visual Studio defines __int8, __int16, etc…

##### **What is std::size_t?**

The answer is that sizeof (and many functions that return a size or length value) return a value of type *std::size_t*. **std::size_t** is defined as an unsigned integral type, and it is typically used to represent the size or length of objects.

## Floating Point Numbers

The *floating* part of the name *floating point* refers to the fact that the decimal point can “float”; that is, it can support a variable number of digits before and after the decimal point. 

Floating point data types are always signed (can hold positive and negative values).

**Best practice:** Favor double over float unless space is at a premium, as the lack of precision in a float will often lead to inaccuracies.

![image-20221004103554863](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004103554863.png)

```cpp
float fValue;
double dValue;
long double ldValue;
```

When using floating point literals, always include at least one decimal place (even if the decimal is 0). This helps the compiler understand that the number is a floating point number and not an integer.

**Best practice:** Always make sure the type of your literals match the type of the variables they’re being assigned to or used to initialize. Otherwise an unnecessary conversion will result, possibly with a loss of precision.

### Range:

![image-20221004103811619](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004103811619.png)

The **precision** of a floating point number defines how many *significant digits* it can represent without information loss.

#### NaN and Inf:

There are two special categories of floating point numbers. The first is **Inf**, which represents infinity. Inf can be positive or negative. The second is **NaN**, which stands for “Not a Number”. 

## Booleans

Boolean variables are variables that can have only two possible values: *true*, and *false*.

```cpp
bool b1 { true };
bool b2 { false };
b1 = false;
bool b3 {}; // default initialize to false
```

When we print Boolean values, std::cout prints *0* for *false*, and *1* for *true*. 

To get *true* and *false* use: std::cout << std::boolalpha;

## Characters

The char data type is an integral type, meaning the underlying value is stored as an integer. The integer stored by a `char` variable are intepreted as an `ASCII character`.

You can initialize char variables using character literals:

```cpp
char ch2{ 'a' }; // initialize with code point for 'a' (stored as integer 97) (preferred)
char ch1{ 97 }; // initialize with integer 97 ('a') (not preferred)
```

When using std::cout to print a char, std::cout outputs the char variable as an ASCII character, eg. 97 becomes 'a'. 

If you want to read in more than one char at a time (e.g. to read in a name, word, or sentence), you’ll want to use a string instead of a char. A **string** is a collection of sequential characters (and thus, a string can hold multiple symbols).

Single chars are always put in single quotes

Text put between double quotes (e.g. “Hello, world!”) is treated as a string.

**Best practice:** Put stand-alone chars in single quotes (e.g. ‘t’ or ‘\n’, not “t” or “\n”). This helps the compiler optimize more effectively.

### Escape Sequences: (TODO:)

![image-20221004110704612](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004110704612.png)

## Constant variables

In programming, a **constant** is a value that may not be changed. 

```cpp
const double gravity { 9.8 };  // preferred use of const before type
int const sidesInSquare { 4 }; // "east const" style, okay but not preferred
```

**Best practice:** Place `const` before the type (because it is more idiomatic to do so).

**Best practice:** Don’t use `const` when passing by value. (such as function arguments)

**Best practice**: Prefer constant variables over object-like macros with substitution text.

### Constant expressions:

A **constant expression** is an expression that can be evaluated by the compiler at compile-time. 

**Key insight:** Evaluating constant expressions at compile-time makes our compilation take longer (because the compiler has to do more work), but such expressions only need to be evaluated once (rather than every time the program is run). The resulting executables are faster and use less memory.

A const variable is a compile-time constant if its initializer is a constant expression. (eg, const int etc...)

Compile-time constants enable the compiler to perform optimizations that aren’t available with non-compile-time constants. For example, for example whenever the constant `gravity` is used, the compiler can simply substitute the identifier `gravity` with the literal double `9.8`, which avoids having to fetch the value from somewhere in memory.

**Runtime constants** are constants whose initialization values aren’t known until runtime.

When using `const`, our variables could end up as either a compile-time const or a runtime const, depending on whether the initializer is a compile-time expression or not.

A **constexpr** (which is short for “constant expression”) variable can only be a compile-time constant. If the initialization value of a constexpr variable is not a constant expression, the compiler will error.

**Best practice:**

1. Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is known at compile-time should be declared as `constexpr`.
2. Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is not known at compile-time should be declared as `const`.

Keep in mind the compiler can optimize in more ways!

## Literals

**Literals** are unnamed values inserted directly into the code. For example:

```cpp
return 5;                   // 5 is an integer literal
bool myNameIsAlex { true }; // true is a boolean literal
std::cout << 3.4;           // 3.4 is a double literal
```

Literals are sometimes called **literal constants** because their values cannot be reassigned.

Just like objects have a type, all literals have a type. The type of a literal is deduced from the literal’s value. For example, a literal that is a whole number (e.g. `5`) is deduced to be of type `int`.

**Best practice**: Prefer literal suffix L (upper case) over l (lower case).

![image-20221004113428423](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004113428423.png)

## Magic numbers:

A **magic number** is a literal (usually a number) that either has an unclear meaning or may need to be changed later.

In complex programs, it can be very difficult to infer what a literal represents, unless there’s a comment to explain it.

**Best practice:** Avoid magic numbers in your code (use constexpr variables instead).

## Type Conversions:

The value of an object is stored as a sequence of bits, and the data type of the object tells the compiler how to interpret those bits into meaningful values. Different data types may represent the “same” number differently.

For example, the integer value 3 might be stored as binary `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011`, whereas floating point value 3.0 might be stored as binary `0100 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000`.

In most cases, C++ will allow us convert values of one fundamental type to another fundamental type. The process of converting a value from one type to another type is called **type conversion**.

When the compiler does type conversion on our behalf without us explicitly asking, we call this **implicit type conversion**. Eg. double 5.0 become int 5.

**Key insight:** Type conversion produces a new value of the target type from a value of a different type.

**Key insight:** Some type conversions are always safe to make (such as `int` to `double`), whereas others may result in the value being changed during conversion (such as `double` to `int`). Unsafe implicit conversions will typically either generate a compiler warning, or (in the case of brace initialization) an error.

### Explicit type conversion

```cpp
static_cast<new_type>(expression)
```

**Key insight:** Whenever you see C++ syntax (excluding the preprocessor) that makes use of angled brackets (<>), the thing between the angled brackets will most likely be a type. This is typically how C++ deals with code that need a parameterized type.

**Warning:** The static_cast operator will produce undefined behavior if the value being converted doesn’t fit in range of the new type.

Example:

```cpp
char ch{ 97 }; // 97 is ASCII code for 'a'
std::cout << ch << " has value " << static_cast<int>(ch) << '\n'; // print value of variable ch as an int
```

#### Type casting:

C++ supports 5 different types of casts: `C-style casts`, `static casts`, `const casts`, `dynamic casts`, and `reinterpret casts`. The latter four are sometimes referred to as **named casts**. 

**Warning**: Avoid const casts and reinterpret casts unless you have a very good reason to use them.

**Best practice**: Favor static_cast when you need to convert a value from one type to another type. (The above)

### Implicit type conversion

Performed automatically by the compiler when one data type is required, but a different data type is supplied.

When a type conversion is invoked (whether implicitly or explicitly), the compiler will determine whether it can convert the value from the current type to the desired type. If a valid conversion can be found, then the compiler will produce a new value of the desired type.

If the compiler can’t find an acceptable conversion, then the compilation will fail with a compile error.

**As an aside:** How do you have a type conversion with zero conversions? As an example, on architectures where `int` and `long` both have the same size and range, the same sequence of bits is used to represent values of both types. Therefore, no actual conversion is needed to convert a value between those types -- the value can simply be copied.

The C++ language standard defines how different fundamental types (and in some cases, compound types) can be converted to other types. These conversion rules are called the **standard conversions**.

### Numeric Promotions

**A reminder:** The number of bits a data type uses is called its width. A wider data type is one that uses more bits, and a narrower data type is one that uses less bits.

Because C++ is designed to be portable and performant across a wide range of architectures, the language designers did not want to assume a given CPU would be able to efficiently manipulate values that were narrower than the natural data size for that CPU. 

A **numeric promotion** is the type conversion of a narrower numeric type (such as a `char`) to a wider numeric type (typically `int` or `double`) that can be processed efficiently and is less likely to have a result that overflows. 

All numeric promotions are **value-preserving**, which means that all values in the original type are representable without loss of data or precision in the new type. Because such promotions are safe, the compiler will freely use numeric promotion as needed, and will not issue a warning when doing so.

Create a function that only has int as input argument. Numeric promotion can allow us to called with types tha can be **numerically promoted** to match the function parameters.

#### Floating Point Promotion

Using the **floating point promotion** rules, a value of type `float` can be converted to a value of type `double`. 

#### Integral promotion

More complicated than previous category.

- signed char or signed short can be converted to int.
- unsigned char, char8_t, and unsigned short can be converted to int if int can hold the entire range of the type, or unsigned int otherwise.
- If char is signed by default, it follows the signed char conversion rules above. If it is unsigned by default, it follows the unsigned char conversion rules above.
- bool can be converted to int, with false becoming 0 and true becoming 1.

### Numeric Conversions

C++ supports another category of numeric type conversions, called **numeric conversions**, that cover additional type conversions not covered by the numeric promotion rules. 

#### Narrowing conversions

Unlike a numeric promotion (which is always safe), a numeric conversion may (or may not) result in the loss of data or precision.

**Warning**: Compilers will often *not* warn when converting a signed int to an unsigned int, or vice-versa, even though these are narrowing conversions. Be extra careful of inadvertent conversions between these types (particularly when passing an argument to a function taking a parameter of the opposite sign).

**Best practice**: Avoid narrowing conversions whenever possible. If you do need to perform one, use `static_cast` to make it an explicit conversion.

### Arithmetic Conversions

When we mix different types in an operation. 

In C++, certain operators require that their operands be of the same type. If one of these operators is invoked with operands of different types, one or both of the operands will be implicitly converted to matching types using a set of rules called the **usual arithmetic conversions**.

#### The operators that require operands of the same type

The following operators require their operands to be of the same type:

- The binary arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
- The binary relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- The binary bitwise arithmetic operators: &, ^, |
- The conditional operator ?: (excluding the condition, which is expected to be of type `bool`)

#### The usual arithmetic conversion rules

The usual arithmetic conversion rules are pretty simple. The compiler has a prioritized list of types that looks something like this:

- long double (highest)
- double
- float
- unsigned long long
- long long
- unsigned long
- long
- unsigned int
- int (lowest)

Also:

- If the type of at least one of the operands is on the priority list, the operand with lower priority is converted to the type of the operand with higher priority.
- Otherwise (the type of neither operand is on the list), both operands are numerically promoted

### Functions

To see what type of a resulting expression use typeid.name(),example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo> // for typeid()

int main()
{
    int i{ 2 };
    double d{ 3.5 };
    std::cout << typeid(i + d).name() << ' ' << i + d << '\n'; // show us the type of i + d

    return 0;
}
```

## Typedefs and type aliases

In C++, **using** is a keyword that creates an alias for an existing data type. To create such a type alias, we use the `using` keyword, followed by a name for the type alias, followed by an equals sign and an existing data type. For example:

```cpp
using Distance = double; // define Distance as an alias for type double
```

```cpp
Distance milesToDestination{ 3.4 }; // defines a variable of type double
```

#### **Naming type aliases**

Historically, there hasn’t been a lot of consistency in how type aliases have been named. There are three common naming conventions (and you will run across all of them):

- Type aliases that end in a “_t” suffix (the “_t” is short for “type”). This convention is often used by the standard library for globally scoped type names (like `size_t` and `nullptr_t`).
- Type aliases that end in a “_type” suffix. This convention is used by some standard library types (like `std::string`) to name nested type aliases (e.g. `std::string::size_type`).

- Type aliases that use no suffix.

In modern C++, the convention is to name type aliases (or any other type) that you define yourself starting with a capital letter, and using no suffix. The capital letter helps differentiate the names of types from the names of variables and functions (which start with a lower case letter), and prevents naming collisions between them.

**Best practice**: Name your type aliases starting with a capital letter and do not use a suffix (unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise).

An alias does not actually define a new, distinct type (one that is considered separate from other types) -- it just introduces a new identifier for an existing type. A type alias is completely interchangeable with the aliased type.

Because scope is a property of an identifier, type alias identifiers follow the same scoping rules as variable identifiers: a type alias defined inside a block has block scope and is usable only within that block, whereas a type alias defined in the global namespace has file scope and is usable to the end of the file.

Uses:

### **Using type aliases for platform independent coding**

One of the primary uses for type aliases is to hide platform specific details. On some platforms, an `int` is 2 bytes, and on others, it is 4 bytes. Thus, using `int` to store more than 2 bytes of information can be potentially dangerous when writing platform independent code.

```cpp
#ifdef INT_2_BYTES
using int8_t = char;
using int16_t = int;
using int32_t = long;
#else
using int8_t = char;
using int16_t = short;
using int32_t = int;
#endif
```

### **Using type aliases to make complex types easier to read**

Although we have only dealt with simple data types so far, in advanced C++, types can be complicated and lengthy to manually enter on your keyboard.

### **Using type aliases for legibility**

Type aliases can also help with code documentation and comprehension.

With variables, we have the variable’s identifier to help document the purpose of the variable. But consider the case of a function’s return value. Data types such as `char`, `int`, `long`, `double`, and `bool` are describe what *type* a function returns, but more often we want to know what *purpose* a return value serves.

**Best practice**: Use type aliases judiciously, when they provide a clear benefit to code readability or code maintenance.

## Type deductions

**Type deduction** (also sometimes called **type inference**) is a feature that allows the compiler to deduce the type of an object from the object’s initializer. To use type deduction, the `auto` keyword is used in place of the variable’s type. 

```cpp
int main()
{
    auto d{ 5.0 }; // 5.0 is a double literal, so d will be type double
    auto i{ 1 + 2 }; // 1 + 2 evaluates to an int, so i will be type int
    auto x { i }; // i is an int, so x will be type int too

    return 0;
}
```

Type deduction will not work for objects that do not have initializers or empty initializers.

In most cases, type deduction will drop the `const` qualifier from deduced types. For example:

```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x { 5 }; // x has type const int
    auto y { x };      // y will be type int (const is dropped)
}
```

### Pros and cons:

Type deduction is not only convenient, but also has a number of other benefits.

First, if two or more variables are defined on sequential lines, the names of the variables will be lined up, helping to increase readability:

```cpp
// harder to read
int a { 5 };
double b { 6.7 };

// easier to read
auto c { 5 };
auto d { 6.7 };
```

Second, type deduction only works on variables that have initializers, so if you are in the habit of using type deduction, it can help avoid unintentionally uninitialized variables:

```cpp
int x; // oops, we forgot to initialize x, but the compiler may not complain
auto y; // the compiler will error out because it can't deduce a type for y
```

Third, you are guaranteed that there will be no unintended performance-impacting conversions:

```cpp
double x { 5 }; // bad: implicitly converts 5 from an int to a double
auto y { 5 }; // good: y is an int (hopefully that's what you wanted) and no conversion takes place
```

Type deduction also has a few downsides.

First, type deduction obscures an object’s type information in the code. Although a good IDE should be able to show you the deduced type (e.g. when hovering a variable), it’s still a bit easier to make type-based mistakes when using type deduction.

```cpp
auto y { 5 }; // oops, we wanted a double here but we accidentally provided an int literal
```

Second, if the type of an initializer changes, the type of a variable using type deduction will also change, perhaps unexpectedly. Consider:

```cpp
auto sum { add(5, 6) + gravity };
```

If the return type of `add` changes from int to double, or `gravity` changes from int to double, `sum` will also change types from int to double.

**Best practice**: Use type deduction for your variables, unless you need to commit to a specific type.

### Functions:

**Best practice**: Favor explicit return types over function return type deduction for normal functions.

**Type deduction can’t be used for function parameter types**

## Extra:

### Outputting values in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal:

By default, C++ outputs values in decimal. However, you can change the output format via use of the `std::dec`, `std::oct`, and `std::hex` I/O manipulators.
