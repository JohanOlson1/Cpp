# User Defined Variables

There are hundreds of other potentially useful types that C++ doesn’t include because it’s just not possible to anticipate everything that someone might need (let alone implement and test those things). 

Instead, C++ solves for such problems in a different way: by allowing us to create entirely new, custom types for use in our programs! Such types are often called **user-defined types** (though we think the term **program-defined types** is better. C++ has two categories of compound types that allow for this: the enumerated types (including unscoped and scoped enumerations), and the class types (including structs, classes, and unions).

The definition for a program-defined type is called a **type definition**.

**Warning**: Don’t forget to end your type definitions with a semicolon, otherwise the compiler will typically error on the next line of code.

**Best practice**: Name your program-defined types starting with a capital letter and do not use a suffix.

## Use in a multi-file program

To propagate type definitions into the code files that need them, program-defined types are typically defined in header files, and then #included into any code file that requires that type definition.  These header files are typically given the same name as the program-defined type (e.g. a program-defined type named Fraction would be defined in Fraction.h)

**Best practice:**

- A program-defined type used in only one code file should be defined in that code file as close to the first point of use as possible.

- A program-defined type used in multiple code files should be defined in a header file with the same name as the program-defined type and then #included into each code file as needed.

To use a given function or global variable in a file that does not contain the definition, we need a forward declaration (which we typically propagate via a header file). This works because declarations are enough to satisfy the compiler when it comes to functions and non-constexpr variables, and the linker can then connect everything up.

However, using forward declarations in a similar manner doesn’t work for types, because the compiler typically needs to see the full definition to use a given type. We must be able to propagate the full type definition to each code file that needs it.

To allow for this, types are partially exempt from the one-definition rule: a given type is allowed to be defined in multiple code files.

There are two caveats that are worth knowing about. First, you can still only have one type definition per code file (this usually isn’t a problem since header guards will prevent this). Second, all of the type definitions for a given type must be identical, otherwise undefined behavior will result.

## Enumerated types

An **enumeration** (also called an **enumerated type** or an **enum**) is a compound data type where every possible value is defined as a symbolic constant (called an **enumerator**). 

Enumerations are program-defined types.

Enumerators are *integral* symbolic constants. As a result, enumerated types actually hold an integral value.

When we define an enumerator, each enumerator is automatically assigned an integer value based on its position in the enumerator list. By default, the first enumerator is assigned the integral value `0`, and each subsequent enumerator has a value one greater than the previous enumerator.

### Unscoped Enumerations

Unscoped enumerations are defined via the `enum` keyword.

```cpp
// Define a new unscoped enumeration named Color
enum Color
{
    // Here are the enumerators
    // These symbolic constants define all the possible values this type can hold
    // Each enumerator is separated by a comma, not a semicolon
    red,
    green,
    blue, // trailing comma optional but recommended
}; // the enum definition must end with a semicolon

int main()
{
    // Define a few variables of enumerated type Color
    Color apple { red };   // my apple is red
    Color shirt { green }; // my shirt is green
    Color cup { blue };    // my cup is blue

    Color socks { white }; // error: white is not an enumerator of Color
    Color hat { 2 };       // error: 2 is not an enumerator of Color

    return 0;
}
```

Inside a pair of curly braces, we define the enumerators for the `Color` type: `red`, `green`, and `blue`. These enumerators specify the set of possible values that objects of type `Color` will be able to hold. Each enumerator must be separated by a comma (not a semicolon) -- a trailing comma after the last enumerator is optional but recommended for consistency.

Inside `main()`, we instantiate three variables of type `Color`: `apple` is initialized with the color `red`, `shirt` is initialized with the color `green`, and `cup` is initialized with the color `blue`. Memory is allocated for each of these objects. Note that the initializer for an enumerated type must be one of the defined enumerators for that type.

**Warning:** Enumerations don’t have to be named, but unnamed enumerations should be avoided in modern C++.

**Best practice**: Name your enumerated types starting with a capital letter. Name your enumerators starting with a lower case letter.

**Enumerated types are distinct types:** Each enumerated type you create is considered to be a **distinct type**, meaning the compiler can distinguish it from other types (unlike typedefs or type aliases, which are considered non-distinct from the types they are aliasing).

Example of use: 

Sometimes functions will return a status code to the caller to indicate whether the function executed successfully or encountered an error. Traditionally, small negative numbers were used to represent different possible error codes.

However, using magic numbers like this isn’t very descriptive. A better method would be to use an enumerated type:

```cpp
enum FileReadResult
{
    readResultSuccess,
    readResultErrorFileOpen,
    readResultErrorFileRead,
    readResultErrorFileParse,
};

FileReadResult readFileContents()
{
    if (!openFile())
        return readResultErrorFileOpen;
    if (!readFile())
        return readResultErrorFileRead;
    if (!parseFile())
        return readResultErrorFileParse;

    return readResultSuccess;
}
```

#### Avoid naming collisions

Unscoped enumerations are named such because they put their enumerator names into the same scope as the enumeration definition itself (as opposed to creating a new scope region like a namespace does).

One consequence of this is that an enumerator name can’t be used in multiple enumerations within the same scope.

An option is to put the enumerated type inside something that provides a separate scope region, such as a namespace:

```cpp
namespace color
{
    // The names Color, red, blue, and green are defined inside namespace color
    enum Color
    {
        red,
        green,
        blue,
    };
}

namespace feeling
{
    enum Feeling
    {
        happy,
        tired,
        blue, // feeling::blue doesn't collide with color::blue
    };
}

int main()
{
    color::Color paint { color::blue };
    feeling::Feeling me { feeling::blue };

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: Prefer putting your enumerations inside a named scope region (such as a namespace or class) so the enumerators don’t pollute the global namespace.

#### Input and output

**Best practice**: Avoid assigning explicit values to your enumerators unless you have a compelling reason to do so.

**Unscoped enumerations will implicitly convert to integral values**: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Color
{
    black, // assigned 0
    red, // assigned 1
    blue, // assigned 2
    green, // assigned 3
    white, // assigned 4
    cyan, // assigned 5
    yellow, // assigned 6
    magenta, // assigned 7
};

int main()
{
    Color shirt{ blue };

    std::cout << "Your shirt is " << shirt; // outputs 2

    return 0;
}
```

Most of the time, printing an enumeration as an integral value (such as `2`) isn’t what we want. Instead, we typically will want to print the name of whatever the enumerator represents (`blue`). But to do that, we need some way to convert the integral value of the enumeration (`2`) into a string matching the enumerator name (`"blue"`).

An efficient way to do so is to use a switch statement. In the following example, we will also return our `Color` as a `std::string`, to give the caller more flexibility to do whatever they want with the name (including print it) (C++20):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

enum Color
{
    black,
    red,
    blue,
};


// We'll show a better version of this for C++17 below
std::string getColor(Color color)
{
    switch (color)
    {
    case black: return "black";
    case red:   return "red";
    case blue:  return "blue";
    default:    return "???";
    }
}

int main()
{
    Color shirt { blue };

    std::cout << "Your shirt is " << getColor(shirt) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Teaching `operator<<` how to print an enumerator**: Another option

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Color
{
	black,
	red,
	blue,
};

// Teach operator<< how to print a Color
// Consider this magic for now since we haven't explained any of the concepts it uses yet
// std::ostream is the type of std::cout
// The return type and parameter type are references (to prevent copies from being made)!
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, Color color)
{
	switch (color)
	{
	case black: out << "black";  break;
	case red:   out << "red";    break;
	case blue:  out << "blue";   break;
	default:    out << "???";    break;
	}

	return out;
}

int main()
{
	Color shirt{ blue };
	std::cout << "Your shirt is " << shirt; // it works!

	return 0;
}
```

##### Size and base

Enumerated types are considered part of the integer family of types, and it’s up to the compiler to determine how much memory to allocate for an enum variable. The C++ standard says the enum size needs to be large enough to represent all of the enumerator values. Most often, it will make enum variables the same size as a standard `int`.

```cpp
// Use an 8-bit unsigned integer as the enum base
enum Color : std::uint8_t
{
    black,
    red,
    blue,
};
```

**Best practice**: Specify the base type of an enumeration only when necessary.

##### Input

Because `Pet` is a program-defined type, the language doesn’t know how to input a Pet using `std::cin`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Pet
{
    cat, // assigned 0
    dog, // assigned 1
    pig, // assigned 2
    whale, // assigned 3
};

int main()
{
    Pet pet { pig };
    std::cin >> pet; // compile error, std::cin doesn't know how to input a Pet

    return 0;
}
```

Similar to how we were able to teach `operator<<` to output an enum type above, we can also teach `operator>>` how to input an enum type:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Pet
{
    cat, // assigned 0
    dog, // assigned 1
    pig, // assigned 2
    whale, // assigned 3
};

// Consider this magic for now
// We pass pet by reference so we can have the function modify its value
std::istream& operator>> (std::istream& in, Pet &pet)
{
    int input{};
    in >> input; // input an integer

    pet = static_cast<Pet>(input);
    return in;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a pet (0=cat, 1=dog, 2=pig, 3=whale): ";

    Pet pet{};
    std::cin >> pet; // input our pet using std::cin

    std::cout << pet << '\n'; // prove that it worked

    return 0;
}
```

### Scoped Enumerations

Although unscoped enumerations are distinct types in C++, they are not type safe, and in some cases will allow you to do things that don’t make sense. Consider the following case:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    enum Color
    {
        red,
        blue,
    };

    enum Fruit
    {
        banana,
        apple,
    };

    Color color { red };
    Fruit fruit { banana };

    if (color == fruit) // The compiler will compare color and fruit as integers
        std::cout << "color and fruit are equal\n"; // and find they are equal!
    else
        std::cout << "color and fruit are not equal\n";

    return 0;
}
```

That solution is the **scoped enumeration** (often called an **enum class** in C++ for reasons that will become obvious shortly).

They have two primary differences: They are strongly typed (they won’t implicitly convert to integers) and strongly scoped (the enumerators are *only* placed into the scope region of the enumeration).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    enum class Color // "enum class" defines this as a scoped enumeration rather than an unscoped enumeration
    {
        red, // red is considered part of Color's scope region
        blue,
    };

    enum class Fruit
    {
        banana, // banana is considered part of Fruit's scope region
        apple,
    };

    Color color { Color::red }; // note: red is not directly accessible, we have to use Color::red
    Fruit fruit { Fruit::banana }; // note: banana is not directly accessible, we have to use Fruit::banana

    if (color == fruit) // compile error: the compiler doesn't know how to compare different types Color and Fruit
        std::cout << "color and fruit are equal\n";
    else
        std::cout << "color and fruit are not equal\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**As an aside:** The `class` keyword (along with the `static` keyword), is one of the most overloaded keywords in the C++ language, and can have different meanings depending on context. Although scoped enumerations use the `class` keyword, they aren’t considered to be a “class type” (which is reserved for structs, classes, and unions).

Unlike unscoped enumerations, which place their enumerators in the same scope as the enumeration itself, scoped enumerations place their enumerators *only* in the scope region of the enumeration. In other words, scoped enumerations act like a namespace for their enumerators.

To access a scoped enumerator, we do so just as if it was in a namespace having the same name as the scoped enumeration:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    enum class Color // "enum class" defines this as a scoped enum rather than an unscoped enum
    {
        red, // red is considered part of Color's scope region
        blue,
    };

    std::cout << red << '\n';        // compile error: red not defined in this scope region
    std::cout << Color::red << '\n'; // compile error: std::cout doesn't know how to print this (will not implicitly convert to int)

    Color color { Color::blue }; // okay

    return 0;
}
```

**Scoped enumerations don’t implicitly convert to integers**

**Best practice**: Favor scoped enumerations over unscoped enumerations unless there’s a compelling reason to do otherwise.

Scoped enumerations are great, but the lack of implicit conversion to integers can sometimes be a pain point.

#### Advanced solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum class Animals
{
    chicken, // 0
    dog, // 1
    cat, // 2
    elephant, // 3
    duck, // 4
    snake, // 5

    maxAnimals,
};

// Overload the unary + operator to convert Animals to the underlying type
// adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/a/42198760, thanks to Pixelchemist for the idea
constexpr auto operator+(Animals a) noexcept
{
    return static_cast<std::underlying_type_t<Animals>>(a);
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << +Animals::elephant << '\n'; // convert Animals::elephant to an integer using unary operator+

    return 0;
}
```

## Structs

There are many instances in programming where we need more than one variable in order to represent something of interest. 

Lets say we want to write a program where we need to store information about the employees in a company. We might be interested in keeping track of attributes such as the employee’s name, title, age, employee id, manager id, wage, birthday, hire date, etc…

If we were to use independent variables to track all of this information, that might look messy.

Fortunately, C++ comes with two compound types designed to solve such challenges: structs (which we’ll introduce now) and classes (which we’ll explore soon). A **struct** (short for **structure**) is a program-defined data type that allows us to bundle multiple variables together into a single type. 

#### Defining structs

Because structs are a program-defined type, we first have to tell the compiler what our struct type looks like before we can begin using it. Here is an example of a struct definition for a simplified employee:

```cpp
struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};
```

The variables that are part of the struct are called **data members** (or **member variables**).

**Tip**: The term `member` is used a lot, so make sure you remember what it means.

As a reminder, `Employee` is just a type definition -- no objects are actually created at this point.

#### Defining struct objects

In order to use the `Employee` type, we simply define a variable of type `Employee`:

```cpp
Employee joe; // Employee is the type, joe is the variable name
```

#### Accessing members

To access a specific member variable, we use the **member selection operator** (`operator.`)

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe;
    joe.id = 14;
    joe.age = 32;
    joe.wage = 60000.0;

    Employee frank;
    frank.id = 15;
    frank.age = 28;
    frank.wage = 45000.0;

    int totalAge { joe.age + frank.age };

    if (joe.wage > frank.wage)
        std::cout << "Joe makes more than Frank\n";
    else if (joe.wage < frank.wage)
        std::cout << "Joe makes less than Frank\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Joe and Frank make the same amount\n";

    // Frank got a promotion
    frank.wage += 5000.0;

    // Today is Joe's birthday
    ++joe.age; // use pre-increment to increment Joe's age by 1

    return 0;
}
```

### Struct aggregate initialization

Much like normal variables, data members are not initialized by default.

In general programming, an **aggregate data type** (also called an **aggregate**) is any type that can contain multiple data members. Some types of aggregates allow members to have different types (e.g. structs), while others require that all members must be of a single type (e.g. arrays).

**For advanced readers:** To be an aggregate in C++, a type must meet the following criteria:

- Is a class type (a struct, class, or union), or an array type (a built-in array or `std::array`).
- Has no private or protected non-static data members.
- Has no user-declared or inherited constructors.
- Has no base classes.
- Has no virtual member functions.

Aggregates use a form of initialization called **aggregate initialization**, which allows us to directly initialize the members of aggregates. To do this, we provide an **initializer list** as an initializer, which is just a list of comma-separated initialization values.

```cpp
struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

int main()
{
    Employee frank = { 1, 32, 60000.0 }; // copy-list initialization using braced list
    Employee robert ( 3, 45, 62500.0 );  // direct initialization using parenthesized list (C++20)
    Employee joe { 2, 28, 45000.0 };     // list initialization using braced list (preferred)

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: Prefer the (non-copy) braced list form when initializing aggregates.

If an aggregate is initialized but the number of initialization values is fewer than the number of members, then all remaining members will be value-initialized, put to 0.

This means we can use an empty initialization list to value-initialize all members of the struct:

```cpp
Employee joe {}; // value-initialize all members
```

#### **Designated initializers** (C++20)

C++20 adds a new way to initialize struct members called **designated initializers**. Designated initializers allow you to explicitly define which initialization values map to which members. The members must be initialized in the same order in which they are declared in the struct, otherwise an error will result. Members not designated an initializer will be value initialized.

```cpp
struct Foo
{
    int a{ };
    int b{ };
    int c{ };
};

int main()
{
    Foo f1{ .a{ 1 }, .c{ 3 } }; // ok: f.a = 1, f.b = 0 (value initialized), f.c = 3
    Foo f2{ .b{ 2 }, .a{ 1 } }; // error: initialization order does not match order of declaration in struct

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: When adding a new member to an aggregate, it’s safest to add it to the bottom of the definition list so the initializers for other members don’t shift.

#### Assignment with initializer list

Similar to initializing a struct with an initializer list, you can also assign values to structs using an initializer list (which does memberwise assignment):

```cpp
struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe { 1, 32, 60000.0 };
    joe = { joe.id, 33, 66000.0 }; // Joe had a birthday and got a raise

    return 0;
}
```

### Default member initialization

When we define a struct (or class) type, we can provide a default initialization value for each member as part of the type definition. This process is called **non-static member initialization**, and the initialization value is called a **default member initializer**.

```cpp
struct Something
{
    int x;       // no initialization value (bad)
    int y {};    // value-initialized by default
    int z { 2 }; // explicit default value
};

int main()
{
    Something s1; // s1.x is uninitialized, s1.y is 0, and s1.z is 2

    return 0;
}
```

**Key insight:** Using default member initializers (or other mechanisms that we’ll cover later), structs and classes can self-initialize even when no explicit initializers are provided!

We noted that if an aggregate is initialized but the number of initialization values is fewer than the number of members, then all remaining members will be value-initialized. However, if a default member initializer is provided for a given member, that default member initializer will be used instead! 

```cpp
struct Something
{
    int x;       // no default initialization value (bad)
    int y {};    // value-initialized by default
    int z { 2 }; // explicit default value
};

int main()
{
    Something s3 {}; // value initialize s3.x, use default values for s3.y and s3.z

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: Provide a default value for all members. This ensure that your members will be initialized even if the variable definition doesn’t include an initializer list.

**Best practice**: If no explicit initializer values will be provided for an aggregate, prefer value initialization (with an empty braces initializer) to default initialization (with no braces). (When creating the object)

### Struct passing

A big advantage of using structs over individual variables is that we can pass the entire struct to a function that needs to work with the members. Structs are generally passed by (const) reference to avoid making copies.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

void printEmployee(const Employee& employee) // note pass by reference here
{
    std::cout << "ID:   " << employee.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "Age:  " << employee.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "Wage: " << employee.wage << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    Employee joe { 14, 32, 24.15 };
    Employee frank { 15, 28, 18.27 };

    // Print Joe's information
    printEmployee(joe);

    std::cout << '\n';

    // Print Frank's information
    printEmployee(frank);

    return 0;
}
```

Because we are passing the entire struct object (rather than individual members), we only need one parameter no matter how many members the struct object has. And, in the future, if we ever decide to add new members to our `Employee` struct, we will not have to change the function declaration or function call! The new member will automatically be included.

### Returning structs

Structs are usually returned by value, so as not to return a dangling reference.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Point3d
{
    double x { 0.0 };
    double y { 0.0 };
    double z { 0.0 };
};

Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    // We can create a variable and return the variable (we'll improve this below)
    Point3d temp { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
    return temp;
}

// Better version
Point3d_ getZeroPoint_v2()
{
    // We can use empty curly braces to value-initialize all members
    return {};
}

int main()
{
    Point3d zero{ getZeroPoint() };

    if (zero.x == 0.0 && zero.y == 0.0 && zero.z == 0.0)
        std::cout << "The point is zero\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The point is not zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Structs with program-defined members

In C++, structs (and classes) can have members that are other program-defined types. There are two ways to do this.

First, we can define one program-defined type (in the global scope) and then use it as a member of another program-defined type:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

struct Company
{
    int numberOfEmployees {};
    Employee CEO {}; // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
};

int main()
{
    Company myCompany{ 7, { 1, 32, 55000.0 } }; // Nested initialization list to initialize Employee
    std::cout << myCompany.CEO.wage; // print the CEO's wage
}
```

In the above case, we’ve defined an `Employee` struct, and then used that as a member in a `Company` struct. When we initialize our `Company`, we can also initialize our `Employee` by using a nested initialization list.

Second, types can also be nested inside other types, so if an Employee only existed as part of a Company, the Employee type could be nested inside the Company struct:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Company
{
    struct Employee // accessed via Company::Employee
    {
        int id{};
        int age{};
        double wage{};
    };

    int numberOfEmployees{};
    Employee CEO{}; // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
};

int main()
{
    Company myCompany{ 7, { 1, 32, 55000.0 } }; // Nested initialization list to initialize Employee
    std::cout << myCompany.CEO.wage; // print the CEO's wage
}
```

This is more often done with classes, so we’ll talk more about this in a future lesson.

### Struct Size

Typically, the size of a struct is the sum of the size of all its members, but not always!

It turns out, we can only say that the size of a struct will be *at least* as large as the size of all the variables it contains. But it could be larger! For performance reasons, the compiler will sometimes add gaps into structures (this is called **padding**).

**For advanced readers**: The reason compilers may add padding is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but readers who want to learn more can read about [data structure alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment) on Wikipedia. This is optional reading and not required to understand structures or C++!

### Member Selection with pointers and reference

Since references to an object act just like the object itself, we can also use the member selection operator (.) to select a member from a reference to a struct:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

void printEmployee(const Employee& e)
{
    // Use member selection opeartor (.) to select member from reference to struct
    std::cout << "Id: " << e.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "  Age: " << e.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "  Wage: " << e.wage << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    printEmployee(joe);

    return 0;
}
```

Just like any other variable. 

However, use of the member selection operator (.) doesn’t work if you have a pointer to a struct.

With normal variables or references, we can access objects directly. However, because pointers hold addresses, we first need to dereference the pointer to get the object before we can do anything with it. So one way to access a member from a pointer to a struct is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    Employee* ptr{ &joe };
    std::cout << (*ptr).id << '\n'; // Not great but works: First dereference ptr, then use member selection

    return 0;
}
```

However, this is a bit ugly, especially because we need to parenthesize the dereference operation so it will take precedence over the member selection operation.

To make for a cleaner syntax, C++ offers a **member selection from pointer operator (->)** (also sometimes called the **arrow operator**) that can be used to select members from a pointer to an object:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    Employee* ptr{ &joe };
    std::cout << ptr->id << '\n'; // Better: use -> to select member from pointer to object

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: When using a pointer to access the value of a member, use operator->; instead of operator. (the . operator)

### Templates

We run into similar issues as with overloaded functions with aggregate types (both structs/classes/unions and arrays). 

Unlike functions, type definitions can’t be overloaded. 

Much like a function template is a template definition for instantiating functions, a **class template** is a template definition for instantiating class types.

**A reminder:** A “class type” is a struct, class, or union type. Although we’ll be demonstrating “class templates” on structs for simplicity, everything here applies equally well to classes.

Example of template:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
struct Pair
{
    T first{};
    T second{};
};

int main()
{
    Pair<int> p1{ 5, 6 };        // instantiates Pair<int> and creates object p1
    std::cout << p1.first << ' ' << p1.second << '\n';

    Pair<double> p2{ 1.2, 3.4 }; // instantiates Pair<double> and creates object p2
    std::cout << p2.first << ' ' << p2.second << '\n';

    Pair<double> p3{ 7.8, 9.0 }; // creates object p3 using prior definition for Pair<double>
    std::cout << p3.first << ' ' << p3.second << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

This can be combined with fucntion template:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
struct Pair
{
    T first{};
    T second{};
};

template <typename T>
constexpr T max(Pair<T> p)
{
    return (p.first > p.second ? p.first : p.second);
}

int main()
{
    Pair<int> p1{ 5, 6 };
    std::cout << max<int>(p1) << " is larger\n"; // explicit call to max<int>

    Pair<double> p2{ 1.2, 3.4 };
    std::cout << max(p2) << " is larger\n"; // call to max<double> using template argument deduction (prefer this)

    return 0;
}
```

Class templates can have some members using a template type and other members using a normal (non-template) type.

Class templates can also have multiple template types.

#### Working with pairs

Because working with pairs of data is common, the C++ standard library contains a class template named `std::pair` (in the `<utility>` header) that is defined identically to the `Pair` class template with multiple template types in the preceding section. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

template <typename T, typename U>
void print(std::pair<T, U> p)
{
    std::cout << '[' << p.first << ", " << p.second << ']';
}

int main()
{
    std::pair<int, double> p1{ 1, 2.3 }; // a pair holding an int and a double
    std::pair<double, int> p2{ 4.5, 6 }; // a pair holding a double and an int
    std::pair<int, int> p3{ 7, 8 };      // a pair holding two ints

    print(p2);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Multiple files

Just like function templates, class templates are typically defined in header files so they can be included into any code file that needs them. Both template definitions and type definitions are exempt from the one-definition rule, so this won’t cause problems:

pair.h:

```cpp
#ifndef PAIR_H
#define PAIR_H

template <typename T>
struct Pair
{
    T first{};
    T second{};
};

template <typename T>
constexpr T max(Pair<T> p)
{
    return (p.first > p.second ? p.first : p.second);
}

#endif
```

foo.cpp:

```cpp
#include "pair.h"
#include <iostream>

void foo()
{
    Pair<int> p1{ 1, 2 };
    std::cout << max(p1) << " is larger\n";
}
```

main.cpp:

```cpp
#include "pair.h"
#include <iostream>

void foo(); // forward declaration for function foo()

int main()
{
    Pair<double> p2 { 3.4, 5.6 };
    std::cout << max(p2) << " is larger\n";

    foo();

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Class template argument deduction (CTAD)** (C++17)

**Author’s note**: Many future lessons on this site make use of CTAD. If you’re compiling these examples using the C++14 standard, you’ll get an error about missing template arguments. You’ll need to explicitly add such arguments to the example to make it compile.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename U>
struct Pair
{
    T first{};
    U second{};
};

// Here's a deduction guide for our Pair
// Pair objects initialized with arguments of type T and U should deduce to Pair<T, U>
template <typename T, typename U>
Pair(T, U) -> Pair<T, U>;

int main()
{
    Pair<int, int> p1{ 1, 2 }; // explicitly specify class template Pair<int, int> (C++11 onward)
    Pair p2{ 1, 2 };     // CTAD used to deduce Pair<int, int> from the initializers (C++17)

    return 0;
}
```

First, we use the same template type definition as in our `Pair` class. This makes sense, because if our deduction guide is going to tell the compiler how to deduce the types for a `Pair<T, U>`, we have to define what `T` and `U` are (template types). Second, on the right hand side of the arrow, we have the type that we’re helping the compiler to deduce. In this case, we want the compiler to be able to deduce template arguments for objects of type `Pair<T, U>`, so that’s exactly what we put here. Finally, on the left side of the arrow, we tell the compiler what kind of declaration to look for. In this case, we’re telling it to look for a declaration of some object named `Pair` with two arguments (one of type `T`, the other of type `U`)

Here’s a similar example for a Pair that takes a single template type:

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct Pair
{
    T first{};
    T second{};
};

// Here's a deduction guide for our Pair
// pair objects initialized with arguments of type T and T should deduce to Pair<T>
template <typename T>
Pair(T, T)->Pair<T>;

int main()
{
    Pair<int> p1{ 1, 2 }; // explicitly specify class template Pair<int> (C++11 onward)
    Pair p2{ 1, 2 };     // CTAD used to deduce Pair<int, int> from the initializers (C++17)

    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion

While structs are useful in and of themselves, classes (which are the heart of C++ and object oriented programming) build directly on top of the concepts we’ve introduced here. Having a good understanding of structs (especially data members, member selection, and default member initialization) will make your transition to classes that much easier.
