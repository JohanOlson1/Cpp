## 8. Control Flow

**Control flow statements** (also called **flow control statements**), are statements that allow the programmer to change the normal path of execution through the program. 

When a `control flow statement` causes point of execution to change to a non-sequential statement, this is called **branching**.

### If statements 

Use blocks for each statement. Not needed if only one statement though. 

**Best practice**: Consider putting single statements associated with an `if` or `else` in blocks (particularly while you are learning). More experienced C++ developers sometimes disregard this practice in favor of tighter vertical spacing.

**Warning:** Initialization of variables inside a block will be local, and destroyed at the end of block. 

A **null statement** is an expression statement that consists of just a semicolon. Don't put them at the end of the condition! 

**Warning**: Be careful not to “terminate” your `if statement` with a semicolon, otherwise your conditional statement(s) will execute unconditionally (even if they are inside a block).

```cpp
if (x > 0)
{
    std::cout << "The value is positive\n";
}
else if (x < 0)
{
	std::cout << "The value is negative\n";
}
else 
{
    std::cout << "The value is zero\n";    
}

```

To properly comply with C++’s type checking, either the type of both expressions in a conditional statement must match, or the both expressions must be convertible to a common type.

The conversion rules used when the types don’t match are rather complicated. You can find them [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_other).

The condition in paranthesis return either 0 "false" or 1 "true". So if(0) is false, while if(1) is true. 

#### Logicals:

**Warning:** Avoid using operator== and operator!= to compare floating point values if there is any chance those values have been calculated.

**Best practice:** Don’t add unnecessary == or != to conditions. It makes them harder to read without offering any additional value.

![image-20221004135320333](C:\Users\Johan\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20221004135320333.png)

**Best practice**: If *logical NOT* is intended to operate on the result of other operators, the other operators and their operands need to be enclosed in parentheses.

**Key insight**: The Logical OR and logical AND operators are an exception to the rule that the operands may evaluate in any order, as the standard explicitly states that the left operand must evaluate first.

**Best practice**: When mixing *logical AND* and *logical OR* in a single expression, explicitly parenthesize each operation to ensure they evaluate how you intend.

### Switch Statement

Because testing a variable or expression for equality against a set of different values is common, C++ provides an alternative conditional statement called a **switch statement** that is specialized for this purpose.

The idea behind a **switch statement** is simple: an expression (sometimes called the `condition`) is evaluated to produce a value. If the expression’s value is equal to the value after any of the `case labels`, the statements after the matching `case label` are executed. If no matching value can be found and a `default label` exists, the statements after the `default label` are executed instead.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printDigitName(int x)
{
    switch (x)
    {
        case 1:
            std::cout << "One";
            return;
        case 2:
            std::cout << "Two";
            return;
        case 3:
            std::cout << "Three";
            return;
        default:
            std::cout << "Unknown";
            return;
    }
}

int main()
{
    printDigitName(2);
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: Prefer `switch statements` over if-else chains when there is a choice.

The one restriction is that the condition must evaluate to an integral type. 

Why does the switch type only allow for integral (or enumerated) types? The answer is because switch statements are designed to be highly optimized. 

There is no practical limit to the number of case labels you can have, but all case labels in a switch must be unique.

**Best practice**: Place the default case last in the switch block.

A **break statement** (declared using the `break` keyword) tells the compiler that we are done executing statements within the switch, and that execution should continue with the statement after the end of the switch block. This allows us to exit a `switch statement` without exiting the entire function.

**Best practice**: Each set of statements underneath a label should end in a `break statement` or a `return statement`. This includes the statements underneath the last label in the switch. 

**Warning**: Once the statements underneath a case or default label have started executing, they will overflow (fallthrough) into subsequent cases. `Break` or `return` statements are typically used to prevent this.

**Attributes** are a modern C++ feature that allows the programmer to provide the compiler with some additional data about the code. To specify an attribute, the attribute name is placed between double hard braces. Attributes are not statements -- rather, they can be used almost anywhere where they are contextually relevant.

The `[[fallthrough]]` attribute modifies a `null statement` to indicate that fallthrough is intentional (and no warnings should be triggered). 

**Best practice**: Use the `[[fallthrough]]` attribute (along with a null statement) to indicate intentional fallthrough.

Unlike *if statements* the statements after labels are all scoped to the the switch block. No implicit blocks are created.

**Best practice**: If defining variables used in a case statement, do so in a block inside the case.

### Goto statement

Goto is an unconditional jump. An unconditional jump causes execution to jump to another spot in the code. The term “unconditional” means the jump always happens. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // for sqrt() function

int main()
{
    double x{};
tryAgain: // this is a statement label
    std::cout << "Enter a non-negative number: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x < 0.0)
        goto tryAgain; // this is the goto statement

    std::cout << "The square root of " << x << " is " << std::sqrt(x) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

In this program, the user is asked to enter a non-negative number. However, if a negative number is entered, the program utilizes a `goto statement` to jump back to the tryAgain label. The user is then asked again to enter a new number. In this way, we can continually ask the user for input until he or she enters something valid.

The `goto statement` and its corresponding `statement label` must appear in the same function.

Can be used to jump forward as well:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printCats(bool skip)
{
    if (skip)
        goto end; // jump forward; statement label 'end' is visible here due to it having function scope

    std::cout << "cats\n";
end:
    ; // statement labels must be associated with a statement
}

int main()
{
    printCats(true);  // jumps over the print statement and doesn't print anything
    printCats(false); // prints "cats"

    return 0;
}
```

There are two primary limitations to jumping: You can jump only within the bounds of a single function (you can’t jump out of one function and into another), and if you jump forward, you can’t jump forward over the initialization of any variable that is still in scope at the location being jumped to. For example:

**Best practice**: Avoid `goto statements` (unless the alternatives are significantly worse for code readability).

Almost any code written using a `goto statement` can be more clearly written using other constructs in C++, such as `if statements` and loops. One notable exception is when you need to exit a nested loop but not the entire function -- in such a case, a `goto` to just beyond the loops is probably the cleanest solution.

### While Loop

A `while statement` is declared using the **while** keyword. When a `while statement` is executed, the `condition` is evaluated. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the associated statement executes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int count{ 1 };
    while (count <= 10)
    {
        std::cout << count << ' ';
        ++count;
    }

    std::cout << "done!\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Infinite loop:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{

    while (true) // infinite loop
    {
        std::cout << "Loop again (y/n)? ";
        char c{};
        std::cin >> c;

        if (c == 'n')
            return 0;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: Favor `while(true)` for intentional infinite loops.

**Best practice**: Loop variables should be of type (signed) int.

### Do While Loop

A **do while statement** is a looping construct that works just like a while loop, except the statement always executes at least once. After the statement has been executed, the do-while loop checks the condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the path of execution jumps back to the top of the do-while loop and executes it again.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // selection must be declared outside of the do-while so we can use it later
    int selection{};

    do
    {
        std::cout << "Please make a selection: \n";
        std::cout << "1) Addition\n";
        std::cout << "2) Subtraction\n";
        std::cout << "3) Multiplication\n";
        std::cout << "4) Division\n";
        std::cin >> selection;
    }
    while (selection != 1 && selection != 2 &&
        selection != 3 && selection != 4);

    // do something with selection here
    // such as a switch statement

    std::cout << "You selected option #" << selection << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

One thing worth discussing in the above example is that the `selection` variable must be declared outside of the do block. If the `selection` variable were to be declared inside the do block, it would be destroyed when the do block terminates, which happens before the conditional is evaluated. 

**Best practice**: Favor while loops over do-while when given an equal choice.

### For Loop

**Best practice**:

- Prefer `for loops` over `while loops` when there is an obvious loop variable.
- Prefer `while loops` over `for loops` when there is no obvious loop variable.



As of C++11, there are two different kinds of `for loops`. The classic `for statement`, and the newer `range-based for statement`. 

A `for statement` is evaluated in 3 parts:

First, the init-statement is executed. This only happens once when the loop is initiated. The init-statement is typically used for variable definition and initialization. These variables have “loop scope”, which really just is a form of block scope where these variables exist from the point of definition through the end of the loop statement.

Second, for each loop iteration, the condition is evaluated. If this evaluates to true, the statement is executed. 

Finally, after the statement is executed, the end-expression is evaluated. Typically, this expression is used to increment or decrement the loop variables defined in the init-statement.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    for (int count{ 9 }; count >= 0; --count) \\ Initial, Condition and end-expression
    {
         std::cout << count << ' ';
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

When writing a loop condition involving a value, we can often write the condition in many different ways.

**Best practice**: Avoid `operator!=` when doing numeric comparisons in the for-loop condition.

#### Omit statements:

It is possible to write *for loops* that omit any or all of the statements or expressions. For example, in the following example, we’ll omit the init-statement and end-expression, leaving only the condition. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int count{ 0 };
    for ( ; count < 10; ) // no init-statement or end-expression
    {
        std::cout << count << ' ';
        ++count;
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

You’d probably expect an omitted condition-expression to be treated as `false`. However, the C++ standard explicitly (and inconsistently) defines that an omitted condition-expression in a for loop should be treated as `true`.

Recommend avoiding this form of the for loop altogether and using `while(true)` instead.

#### Multiple variables:

Although `for loops` typically iterate over only one variable, sometimes `for loops` need to work with multiple variables. To assist with this, the programmer can define multiple variables in the init-statement, and can make use of the comma operator to change the value of multiple variables in the end-expression:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    for (int x{ 0 }, y{ 9 }; x < 10; ++x, --y)
        std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Best practice**: Defining multiple variables (in the init-statement) and using the comma operator (in the end-expression) is acceptable inside a `for statement`.

#### For-each Loop

There’s a simpler and safer type of loop called a **for-each** loop (also called a **range-based for-loop**) for cases where we want to iterate through every element in an array (or other list-type structure).

When this statement is encountered, the loop will iterate through each element in array, assigning the value of the current array element to the variable declared in element_declaration. For best results, element_declaration should have the same type as the array elements, otherwise type conversion will occur.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr int fibonacci[]{ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 };
    for (auto number : fibonacci) // iterate over array fibonacci
    {
       std::cout << number << ' '; // we access the array element for this iteration through variable number
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

Note that variable number is not an array index. It’s assigned the value of the array element for the current loop iteration.

Because element_declaration should have the same type as the array elements, this is an ideal case in which to use the `auto` keyword, and let C++ deduce the type of the array elements for us.

##### References

Above each array element iterated over will be copied into variable element. Copying array elements can be expensive, and most of the time we really just want to refer to the original element. Fortunately, we can use references for this:

```cpp
std::string array[]{ "peter", "likes", "frozen", "yogurt" };
for (const auto& element: array) // The ampersand makes element a reference to the actual array element, preventing a copy from being made
{
    std::cout << element << ' ';
}
```

**Best practice**: In for-each loops element declarations, if your elements are non-fundamental types, use references or `const` references for performance reasons.

*For-each* loops don’t only work with fixed arrays, they work with many kinds of list-like structures, such as vectors (e.g. `std::vector`), linked lists, trees, and maps.

*For-each* loops provide a superior syntax for iterating through an array when we need to access all of the array elements in forwards sequential order. It should be preferred over the standard for loop in the cases where it can be used. To prevent making copies of each element, the element declaration can be a reference.

##### In functions

In order to iterate through the array, for-each needs to know how big the array is, which means knowing the array size. Because arrays that have decayed into a pointer do not know their size, for-each loops will not work with them!

##### Index

Since C++20, range-based for-loops can be used with an **init-statement** just like the init-statement in normal for-loops. We can use the init-statement to create a manual index counter without polluting the function in which the for-loop is placed.

The init-statement is placed right before the loop variable.

The `int i{ 0 };` is the init-statement, it only gets executed once when the loop starts. At the end of each iteration, we increment `i`, similar to a normal for-loop. However, if we were to use `continue` inside the loop, the `++i` would get skipped, leading to unexpected results. If you use `continue`, you need to make sure that `i` gets incremented before the `continue` is encountered.

### Break and Continue

Many textbooks caution readers not to use `break` and `continue` in loops, both because it causes the execution flow to jump around, and because it can make the flow of logic harder to follow. 

However, used judiciously, `break` and `continue` can help make loops more readable by keeping the number of nested blocks down and reducing the need for complicated looping logic.

**Best practice**: Use break and continue when they simplify your loop logic.

**Best practice**: Use early returns when they simplify your function’s logic.

#### Break: 

In the context of a loop, a break statement can be used to end the loop early. Execution continues with the next statement after the end of the loop.

Break is also a common way to get out of an intentional infinite loop.

A `return statement` terminates the entire function that the loop is within, and execution continues at point where the function was called. The break terminates the loop only.

#### Continue:

The **continue statement** provides a convenient way to end the current iteration of a loop without terminating the entire loop.

In the case of a for loop, the end-statement of the for loop still executes after a continue (since this happens after the end of the loop body).

Be careful when using a `continue statement` with while or do-while loops. These loops typically change the value of variables used in the condition inside the loop body. If use of a `continue statement` causes these lines to be skipped, then the loop can become infinite!

### Halts

A **halt** is a flow control statement that terminates the program.

 In C++, halts are implemented as functions (rather than keywords), so our halt statements will be function calls.

When a program exits normally. The `main()` function returns (either by reaching the end of the function, or via a `return statement`), a number of different things happen. 

**First**, because we’re leaving the function, all local variables and function parameters are destroyed (as per usual).

**Next**, a special function called `std::exit()` is called, with the return value from `main()` (the `status code`) passed in as an argument.

Although `std::exit()` is called implicitly when function `main()` ends, `std::exit()` can also be called explicitly to halt the program before it would normally terminate.

Example:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for std::exit()
#include <iostream>

void cleanup()
{
    // code here to do any kind of cleanup required
    std::cout << "cleanup!\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << 1 << '\n';
    cleanup();

    std::exit(0); // terminate and return status code 0 to operating system

    // The following statements never execute
    std::cout << 2 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Warning**: The `std::exit()` function does not clean up local variables in the current function or up the call stack.

Because `std::exit()` terminates the program immediately, you may want to manually do some cleanup before terminating. Tje cleanup can be done manually but also using **std::atexit**.

Allows you to specify a function that will automatically be called on program termination via `std:exit()`.

```cpp
    std::atexit(cleanup); // note: we use cleanup rather than cleanup() since we're not making a function call to cleanup() right now
```

**Best practice**: Only use a halt if there is no safe way to return normally from the main function. If you haven’t disabled exceptions, prefer using exceptions for handling errors safely.
