C came first in 1972. C++ came in 1979, developed as an extension to C. Compared to C, C++ is an object-oriented language. C++20 latest version. 

The design philosophy is "trust the programer", allowing high degree of freedom but not stoping you from doing things that don't make sense. Therefore equally important to know what not to do, as what to do. 

C# is meant to mean C++++. Although it has more similarities to Java.

## Step 1 - Define the problem to you would like to solve.

 Can be both the hardest or easiest step. You need a well defined idea!

## Step 2 - Determine how to solve the problem

Many different ways to solve a problem. Some are good and some are bad. Good solutions have the following characteristics:

- They are straighforward (not complicated or confusing)
- They are well documented (especially around any assumptions or limitations)
- They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impact on other parts of program
- They are robust, and recover or give useful error messages when unexpected things happen

Studies have shown that only 20% of a programmer’s time is actually spent writing the initial program. The other 80% is spent on maintenance, which can consist of **debugging** (removing bugs), updates to cope with changes in the environment (e.g. to run on a new OS version), enhancements (minor changes to improve usability or capability), or internal improvements (to increase reliability or maintainability).

## Step 3 - Write the program

You need knowledge of programming and a text editor. Specifically a code editor! 

The programs you write will typically be named *something.cpp* or *something.cc*

A program can consist of multiple .cpp files. 

## Step 4 - Compiling your source code

In order to compile a C++ program, we use a C++ compiler. The compiler sequentially goes though each .cpp file and do two things. 

First, it checks so the code follows rules of C++ language. Otherwise it throws an error.

Second, it translates your C++ source code into machine language in an **object file**. Designated *name.o* or *name.obj*.  One object file per .cpp file. 

## Step 5 - Linking object files and libraries

Another program called the linker kicks in next.

First, it takes all object files and combine them into a single executable program. 

Second, it can also link library files. A **library file** is a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” for reuse in other programs.

Third, the linker makes sure all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly. If the linker is unable to connect a reference to something with its definition, you’ll get a linker error, and the linking process will abort.

You then have a executable file that can be run. 

For more complex projects, a **makefile** that describes how to build a program can be used. 

## Step 6 & 7 - Testing and Debugging

If your program runs but doesn’t work correctly, then it’s time for some debugging to figure out what’s wrong.
